Traces of green and vermilion paint can still be seen accentuating the interlace borders of the designs. The religious purpose of this box is indicated by the \"cross\" that divides its face into four fields. Its shape derives from purses, or bursas, made of precious textiles in which saints’ relics were carried.",

Lutma, about seventy-two years old in this portrait, experienced problems with his eyesight as he grew older, which may account for his absent look.Rembrandt printed this sensitive portrait on Japan paper, which imparts a warm tone to the background and heightens the shadows of the dimly lit room. To the upper left of the chair is the circular mark of the eighteenth-century British collector Sir Edward Astley, who occasionally placed his stamp in prominent places within images. His collection was known for its superb Rembrandt etchings.",

    "contextual_sentences": "This is one of the best known copperplate-printed textiles produced at the Oberkampf factory and it presents an abundance of information regarding the complexity of the textile printing process. There are a total of fourteen different scenes depicting activities involved in the process. The designer, Jean-Baptiste Huet, and a female colleague are depicted outdoors sketching, dyers mix colors, and printers apply the printing bocks. The drying of the finished cloth on the grounds of the factory completes the picture. The concept of printing scenes from a manufacturing process exemplifies the Enlightenment fascination with human accomplishments.Jean-Baptiste Huet, an extremely successful decorative painter, was commissioned by Oberkampf to create this design to celebrate the factory's award of the title Manufacture Royale. Huet was then named chief designer at the factory. The formula of individual scenes carefully integrated to form an overall pattern, which was developed in Les Traveaux de la Manufacture, is used repeatedly in copperplate-printed textiles.The factory at Jouy was founded in 1760 by Christophe Oberkampf (1738–1815). It was given the tile of Manufacture Royale by Louis XVI in 1783 and awarded the Legion of Honor by Napoleon I in 1806. It remained in the hands of the same family until the 1820s. Oberkampf received many other awards in recognition of the quality of Jouy's fabrics, as well as for advances in the science and technology of textile printing. The factory employed about a thousand workers during the late eighteenth century. Female workers comprised one-third to one-half the workforce at various times. Female printers earned half the pay of male printers.",

The name traditionally given to this anonymous printmaker, who probably worked in Alsace, derives from a group of approximately seventy printed cards that survive in unique or rare impressions. This is the first of these works to enter the collection.The Master’s deck of cards was composed of number and figure cards in suits that included flowers, birds, deer, wild men, and beasts of prey. For expediency, the Master engraved separate printing plates for each of the figures and each of the suit signs that could be combined on one sheet. The suit of flowers here is represented by a large unfurling blossom that was printed from a different plate than the demure queen. The overall soft tone and the slight slippage in the face of the figure suggest that this small work was most likely printed by hand rather than with the rolling press, which came into common use later in the fifteenth century.",

When this drawing was made, in fact, the Kingdom of Denmark was actively fighting the British in the Gunboat War and the nation was plunging toward bankruptcy. None of this turmoil is evident in Eckersberg’s idyll, in which fashionably dressed civilians, watched over by a lone soldier, seem to be at peace and prosperous.

This panel, together with a related work depicting Saint Ansanus in the Robert Lehman Collection (1975.1.13) and a third panel of Saint Andrew (41.100.23) in the European Paintings Collection, formed part of an altarpiece that was possibly commissioned by the civic government of Siena. The format of the polyptych (multi-paneled altarpiece) was highly unusual in that the central image, the present Madonna and Child, was the same size as the flanking panels, allowing the entire altarpiece, which was intended to be portable, to be easily folded and moved. Like the other two panels from this polyptych in the Museum's collection, the Madonna and Child survives with its original frame intact. In the fifteenth century, Simone's panels were incorporated as the central elements of a larger altarpiece in the principal chapel of the Palazzo Pubblico, Siena's town hall.The altarpiece's five panels are, left to right: Saint Ansanus (Robert Lehman Collection, MMA), Saint Peter (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid), Madonna and Child (Robert Lehman Collection, MMA), Saint Andrew (European Paintings, MMA), and Saint Luke (J.

Reliefs with a representation of the deceased and a short identifying inscription were used to seal burial niches in elaborately decorated communal tombs; those with a half-length or bust format became prevalent sometime after A.D. 65.The relief depicts the upper body of a youthful, beardless man dressed in a Greek garment known as a himation, which wraps around his right arm like a sling, holding a small object, probably a schedula (book roll), in his left hand. His expression is serene, although the intensity of his gaze is emphasized by the large size of his eyes, the modeled eyelids, and the incised concentric circles indicating the iris and pupil of each eye. His hair is depicted as rows of uniform, stylized snail-like curls that cover his head like a cap. The sides and top of the head are rendered in detail, giving a three dimensional aspect to the relief. He stands in front of a dorsalium (draped cloth) affixed by rosettes to a pair of curving leafy branches. An inscription in Palmyrene Aramaic, visible directly to the right of his head, gives his name and lineage, ending with an expression of sorrow common on funerary reliefs at Palmyra. Another inscription, to the right of this one, names a different individual; originally, this slab was probably a double portrait that was cut into two after its removal from the tomb. Small chips and cracks in the surface are due to the use of soft local limestone. Traces of red pigment are visible in the inscription and on the two rosettes. Stylistically, the relief belongs to an early group of Palmyrene male funerary portraits dating to about 50–150 A.D., evidenced by the treatment of the coiffure and the figure’s beardlessness as well as by the manner in which the eyes are carved. In fact, the date can be narrowed further to late in this period (ca. 125–50 A.D.) on the basis of the sensitively modeled carving of the face and the use of pattern-like semicircular shapes among the folds of the himation.",

Unlike his Parisian counterparts, however, this artist exploited the large scale and dramatic lighting commonly reserved for the depiction of monumental architecture and historic statuary for a rustic, vernacular scene.Renewed attention to seventeenth-century Dutch genre scenes spurred an interest among pre-Impressionist painters in the motif of the humble cottage, most often centering on the structure in the context of a landscape or on its role as a setting for manual labor, as in the work of Jean-François Millet.  In this photograph, a whirlwind of disorder and patchwork of intense light and shadow, the half-timbered, thatch-roofed barn and farmyard implements—rakes, baskets, butter churns, buckets—suggest the activity of rural life.  The innovative pictorial approach, with multiple and competing points of focus, closely parallels a natural way of seeing the world.",

Known asxantiles(sing.xantil), these ceramic braziers functioned as receptacles for a type of incense known as copal (tree resin) that, when burned, produced a thick, musky smoke. Rising through the central chamber of these anthropomorphic vessels, the smoke then billowed forth from holes pierced in the hands, chest, mouth, and nostrils. In this way, the burnt offerings allowed ritual practitioners to communicate with the gods.The combination of headdress, pendant tassels, rich polychrome and geometric shapes identifies thisxantilas the god Xochipilli (\"Flower Prince\"). A member of the group of deities known as the Macuiltonaleque, or \"Five Souls,\" he was a patron of music, dance, feasting, and sexuality.

The earliest extant example dates from the time of Charles I (r. 1625–49).Several types of metal threads, plus colored silks, cabochon garnets, and pearls, were used in the creation of this piece. The coat of arms is supported by two intricately detailed beasts, a lion and a unicorn, and these are surrounded by cherubim. The bag has a drawstring closure using cords of silk and metal thread and ending in tassels; four larger tassels decorate the bottom.The king of England traditionally employed an embroiderer, responsible for organizing embroidery projects required by the king and his court. His tasks included presenting designs to the king, procuring supplies, and performing the actual work. The embroiderer decorated both furnishings and costume, as well as horse trappings and ceremonial decorations. For large projects, such as the preparation for a state function, he would have to hire additional workers to assist him with decorations like banners, hangings, and uniforms for the participants.",

    "title": "Martyrdom of St. Lawrence",
    "contextual_sentences": "One of the most famed printmakers of his day, Cornelis Cort was admired for his ability to translate tonal qualities into a black and white engraving. Cort accomplished this in part through an important technical innovation: It is the nature of an engraved line, cut as it is with a tool (the burin) whose cutting edge comes to a sharp triangular point, to begin as a point, swell almost imperceptibly at the center, and narrow to a point again at the end. Cort exploited this quality of the burin line; by varying his pressure on the tool as he gouged the plate, he developed a flexible line that becomes thicker and thinner along its length, creating various degrees of darkness without adding additional lines.In the first half of the sixteenth century, Marcantonio Raimondi had successfully translated the firm contours and plastic form of Raphael's mobile figures into engravings through the use of a systematic network of uniform lines. But Titian, an artist known for his colore rather than his disegno, sought a printmaker who could convey the less tangible atmosphere, color, and light for which his paintings were famed, and specifically commissioned Cort to create engravings after several of his designs. This image of the stoic Saint Lawrence upon the grill combines elements of two paintings by Titian; however, the billows of smoke that provide such a wonderful foil for Cort's supple line are found only in the engraving. Cort's swelling and tapering line would have great importance for subsequent engravers, such as Agostino Carracci (Italian, 1557–1602) and Hendrick Goltzius (Netherlandish, 1558–1617).",

Mary Simon is thought to have composed and basted quilt squares as kits, which she sold to Baltimore quilt makers between 1846 and 1854.Although this type of quilt, in which each square is decorated with a different motif, is commonly called an Album quilt, a true Album quilt is made up of blocks that have been contributed by numerous different makers (see 1988.134). Because this quilt was designed as a complete composition and appears to have been stitched by a single person, most likely to commemorate a specific occasion, it is better described a Presentation quilt. We have no evidence, however, about to whom it was presented or on what occasion. Our quilt is almost identical to the Elizabeth Silver quilt in the collection of the Baltimore Museum of Art, which was commissioned by Elizabeth’s parents, and after its completion, presented to Elizabeth as a wedding gift. Because that quilt is inscribed 1849, the same date has been assigned to the Metropolitan’s work. Underneath the Baltimore Museum quilt's central basket is an inscription to Elizabeth Sliver from her parents. Our quilt once had such an inscription as well, but it was cut away before the piece was quilted, and a plain white patch of fabric was inserted in its place. Did another young woman, for whom this quilt was intended, suddenly break off her wedding plans? Because it came into the Museum's collection without a provenance, we may never know the true history of our beautiful Baltimore quilt.",

    "title": "Funerary mask",
    "contextual_sentences": "This mask, made of hammered sheet gold alloy and covered in red pigment, once adorned the body of a deceased ruler on Peru’s north coast. Powerful dynasties arose in this region between the eighth and the fourteenth centuries A.D. and amassed great riches in gold and silver before they were conquered by the Inca Empire in the late fifteenth century. The lords of these dynasties were the patrons of vast workshops where finely crafted ornaments and ceremonial vessels were created (see 1991.419.62; 66.196.27). At death, the lords were buried deep in monumental mud-brick platform mounds along with large numbers of objects of precious metal, shell, and cloth. In addition to beakers, disks, and other ornaments, the burials included large masks made of sheet gold.  As many as five masks were placed into one burial: one attached to the head of the textile-wrapped body, and the other four stacked at the feet of the deceased.This mask was made of an alloy of 74 percent gold, 20 percent silver, and 6 percent copper which was then hammered into a sheet and shaped into the form of a face. Interestingly, cinnabar, a red mineral pigment, covers much of the cheeks and forehead of this mask, obscuring the gold surface. The cinnabar may emulate the patterning of face paint worn by individuals of importance: according to early colonial accounts a courtier was charged with the task of maintaining such paints. Faint traces of the textile wrappings that once enveloped the mummy bundle can be detected in impressions on the red paint. Masks in museum collections are often missing such surface embellishment (see 1979.206.556), as the pigment would have been removed in modern times to highlight the golden substrate. The eyes of this mask have thin, skewer-like projections emerging from the pupils, perhaps suggesting powerful or even piercing vision. In other masks these projections include small beads of amber and emerald, which have led scholars to interpret the projections as tears. On the ears and ear ornaments can be seen restored examples of the silver-surfaced overlays (now corroded green) that would have also been originally present attached to the mask.  Further surface additions include danglers on the U-shaped nose ornament. Such spangles would have caught the light of the bright sun and conveyed a sense of movement and life as a mummy bundle was conveyed to its final resting place.Masks such as these, with their characteristic ovoid eyes terminating in a point, are associated with the Lambayeque culture, named for a region near the modern city of Chiclayo on Peru’s north coast. This polity, also known as Sicán, erected great monumental centers such as Batán Grande, Chornancap, and other sites. Recent excavations at Chornancap by Carlos Wester and his team have revealed that such masks were part of the burial regalia of high-status women as well as men. According to myths on the north coast, gold was particularly associated with male rulers, silver with noble women, and copper with commoners. A mask from Chornancap, found in the tomb of an importance priestess, was made of silver.The pointed ovoid eyes on this mask and others, sometimes referred to as winged eyes, have been identified as defining features of a being known as the Sicán Deity. According to Izumi Shimada and colleagues, an individual interred with such a mask would have been thought to take on aspects of the Sicán Deity’s power, and would have been transformed into a venerated ancestor upon death.Joanne Pillsbury, Andrall E.

Many, many hundreds of vessels were produced by a variety of different peoples. Ninth- to twelfth-century bowls from the Mimbres Valley of New Mexico are particularly distinctive in their interior decoration, with images of animals native to the Southwest.

The design and spirit of the \"gondola,\" a contemporary term for this ceramic type of a woman in a bath, suggest it was intended to be decorative rather than utilitarian. Employing Palissy's saturated color glazes, textured waves, and shell-like lobes, the piece also hints at the erotic nature of court art through its high-relief rendering of the nude female figure. The partly submerged woman personifying a spring was a popular theme at the court of Fontainebleau, itself named after a local water source, which numerous potters imitating Palissy's style in the nearby village of Avon frequently employed. Palissy himself, known principally for his innovative rustic ceramics, demonstrated an interest in this motif through his numerous works bearing representations of water. In the first decades of the seventeenth century, \"gondola\" cups were also made in silver, silver gilt, amber, crystal, enamel, and natural shell.",

    "contextual_sentences": "This sheet, a relatively recent addition to Rubens's drawn oeuvre, is exceptional in several ways. Even if it seems to have been slightly cropped (especially at the left and the top), it remains one of the artist's largest works on paper. Its technique is much richer than that of most of his other drawings, combining chalk and paints, and gives the work the appearance of an oil sketch. The subject matter may be considered unique for Rubens. In a simple village church, a Catholic priest can be seen preaching to farmers and peasants—men on the left and women on the right—who listen with varying degrees of attentiveness. Obviously observed from nature, the scene can be connected only with the landscapes and studies related to farm life that he made at the end of his career, when he spent much of his time on the estate near Malines that he acquired in 1635. Rubens's composition (if not the vivacity and freshness of the drawing) has been repeated by other artists in a few painted copies. There is, however, no indication that Rubens himself made the drawing for any other reason than to record a moment he had witnessed and thought worthy of his talents.",

    "title": "Omnia Vincit Amor",
    "contextual_sentences": "This image is a pun derived on a famous line in Virgil's tenth Eclogue, 'Love conquers all.' The Latin word omnia, like the Greek word pan, signifies 'all', while amor, the Latin name for Cupid, means 'love', so that Cupid's victorious combat with the woodland god is a visual translation of the phrase. The engraving was produced around the time that Agostino was assisting his brother Annibale in the decoration of the Farnese Gallery, a fresco cycle that also has as its theme the power of love in the universe. As a key to this meaning, Annibale had painted Cupid's successful wrestling match with Pan on one of the feigned medallions that adorn the Farnese ceiling. The subject was not a new one; it had been part of the fresco decoration of Cardinal Bibbiena's stufetta already in 1516, and had also appeared in sixteenth-century emblem books. Agostino himself had painted the battle between Pan and Cupid nearly a decade earlier in the Palazzo Magnani in Bologna.What is unusual about Agostino's engraved version of the subject is his inclusion of the two nymphs. The only clue to their identity is provided by the head ornament of the foreground nymph, which resembles that worn by Diana in one of the scenes of the Farnese Gallery. In that episode, we see Diana about to submit to the advances of an enamored Pan, who tempts her with the offer of a beautiful piece of wool. Perhaps it is also Diana, accompanied by one of her nymphs, who appears with Pan in the engraving. The implication would be that once Pan yields to Love, the chaste Diana herself will succumb. This print is the masterpiece of the simplified and monumental manner that Agostino developed in Rome, its popularity evident from the fact that ten other printmakers are known to have copied it.",

    "contextual_sentences": "This tablet is a later copy of a letter from the last days of the Assyrian empire. In it, the last Assyrian king, Sin-sharra-ishkun, appears to reach out to the Babylonian king Nabopolassar, recognizing the latter’s rule and pleading to retain his own kingdom. The letter represents a great reversal in fortunes: despite frequent rebellions, Babylonia had for centuries been held under Assyrian rule, and at the beginning of his reign Sin-sharra-ishkun himself seems to have had some success in suppressing a rebellion there. By the time this letter was written the tide had turned, and, incredibly, Sin-sharra-ishkun repeatedly addresses Nabopolassar as \"the king my lord.\" We do not have the Babylonian king’s answer in the form of a letter, but he must have rejected its terms: over the following years a coalition led by Babylonia and Media, a state in western Iran, destroyed the Assyrian capitals, and Nabopolassar, ruling from Babylon, came to inherit most of Assyria’s former empire. This letter may have been a response to another surviving piece of correspondence, in which Nabopolassar threatens (or perhaps declares) war, and a desperate attempt by Sin-sharra-ishkun to persuade Nabopolassar to switch allegiances, abandoning his alliance with Media for one with Assyria.The tablet itself is a copy dating to the second century B.C., but the original letter was written over four-hundred years earlier in the late seventh century B.C.; its preservation and copying show that it must have been regarded as historically important even in antiquity.The tablet is not complete and is made up of the following fragments in the Metropolitan's collection: 86.11.370a, c-e and 86.11.383c-e.",

    "title": "Astronomical table clock",
    "contextual_sentences": "This triad of exceptional renaissance clocks, along with several other extraordinary timepieces, entered the Metropolitan Museum’s collection as part of the transformative gift of J. Pierpont Morgan.[3] Although watches were clearly Morgan’s great passion and formed the majority of the donation (17.190.747; 17.190.639; 17.190.634a–d), a guidebook of 1914 remarks, “this collection gives the student a complete illustration not only of the gradual and steady progress of horological art, but also of the beauty of some of the finest examples of it in existence.” [4]The perfection and refinement of time-measuring devices with additional indications and references to the celestial order were the undisputable innovation and artistic accomplishment of South German clockmakers of the Renaissance. Accordingly, intriguing clocks were a necessary part of the Kunstkammer (see pp. 196–99 in this volume). The gilded case of the Augsburg clock of 1568 (17.190.634a–d) is not only embellished with a multitude of engraved and applied ornaments and mythological figures but also indicates with its various auxiliary dials a complex variety of calendrical and astronomical data.[5] The Augsburg clockmaker Jeremias Metzger likely made this and several other, stylistically similar pieces, of which one in the Kunsthistori sches Museum, Vienna, is signed and marked “im.” [6] Princely themes of hunting—depicted within the openwork of the dome—and the allegorical figures that weave around the dials reflect the well-rounded education of the aristocratic owner. The clockmaker Caspar Behaim, who is recorded in Vienna between 1573 and 1584, also acted as an art agent, and he sold the clock during that time.The name mirror clock derives from this form’s resemblance to a Renaissance looking glass (17.190.639); the term monstrance clock is prevalent in inventories and early horological scholarship, and refers to the receptacle for the consecrated Host. Such associations render early clocks a img_url between science and the cosmos and the idea of divine order (see p. 198 in this volume).[7] Matthias Zündt is docu-mented as a journeyman in the workshop of his father-in-law, Wenzel Jamnitzer (see cats. 65, 70, 72). From at least 1560, Zündt was registered as a master goldsmith and gem cutter.[8] He can be called a universal artisan, as he also created models in wood and other materials, as well as ornamental casts; the exuberant stem of this clock can be attributed to him. He is mentioned as Bildenschnitzer (woodcarver) in 1559, when he was working for Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria.[9]Driven by the success of Augsburg clockmakers and demands to restrict outside access to local production, a masterpiece, or chef d’oeuvre, was introduced in Augsburg in 1558.[10] Revised require-ments issued in 1577 asked for, among other elements, “a spring-driven, quarter- striking clock movement with an alarm, a mechanically driven astrolabe, and mechanisms showing the length of the days (Nuremberg hours), the day of the year (calendar), and the days of the week (the planets with their signs). All these dials were to be interconnected and to move together with the motion of the hand on the main time-telling dial.” [11] Likely a masterpiece clock made for admission into the Augsburg clockmakers’ guild, this example (17.190.747) meets all the specified technical requirements. The tower-like form of the case was developed in the sixteenth cen-tury, when Augsburg clockmakers collaborated with metalworkers to make miniature gilded turrets. The architectural structure and the height of the column-framed sides provide an ideal surface for displaying the dials and features. The obelisk at the top is detachable and can serve as a winding key—an inventive example of the mar-riage between form and function. A very similar tower-shaped clock with an obelisk finial is depicted in a painting by Antonio de Pereda in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (fig. 99). Its presence there underlines the status of Augsburg and Nuremberg as the leading European centers of clockmaking in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, as well as the Europe-wide export of these luxury goods, all designed to educate and impress (see also cat. 109 and pp. 198–99 in this volume).Footnotes(For figures cited and key to bibliography shortened references see Koeppe, Making Marvels: Science & Splendor at the Courts of Europe: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2019)1.

The Ilkhanids who governed the Near East from their capital at Tabriz, in modern northwestern Iran, imported precious Chinese wares, commanding local Muslim artists to study Chinese technique and design. The sixteenth-century potters of the Ottoman court though set at the westernmost limit of the Asian world, still pursued–and creatively renewed with great flair and pride–the traditions of the Tabriz school.",

His numerous drawings of lions depict the beasts with large, expressive eyes similar to those of Muhammad Baqir's creature. What differentiates the eighteenth-century drawing from its Safavid forebears is the use of ink wash, a technique borrowed from European sources, to define the musculature of both lion and dragon. Finally, the iconography of this drawing is novel since customarily both dragons and lions are shown defeating a weaker foe.

Groups such as the Scythians, the Yuezhi, the Xiongnu, and the Xianbei achieved a succession of federations and kingdoms in Eurasia by combining the use of sword and bow with an unparalleled skill in horsemanship. Archaeological investigations of burial sites have established the importance of the sword both as a valued possession and a sign of rank in various nomadic societies. While burial context has made it possible to identify some types of swords with specific nomadic peoples, others, like this example, are difficult to attribute with certainty. The complex techniques required for the manufacture of this sword, the combined use of bronze and steel, and the presence of gold decoration all indicate its origin in a society with advanced metalworking skills and a relatively high level of material wealth. Swords similar to this one have been found in Yunan in southwestern China and in Ningxia in the northwest.

Jointed female figurines were dedicated at Greek temples and sanctuaries. Similar pieces, also with the lower arms attached separately, have been excavated from Parthian graves and residences. These Parthian figurines have been variously described as goddesses, dolls, and fertility amulets.",

    "title": "Eagle Transformation Figure",
    "contextual_sentences": "This small, carved sculpture in a whitish greenstone known as albite represents a standing figure bearing both human and avian attributes. The composition is dominated by the figure’s head which occupies the upper half, while the rotund torso with incised umbilicus and limbs are minimally indicated below. The large, spherical eyes are separated by a contoured crest that projects upward above a small nose. The figure’s mouth is an avian beak, partially open as if mid-vocalization. A small beard protrudes from the lower jaw, and similar hairlike incisions begin at the hairline and terminate in an overlapping pattern that might suggest a combination of hair and feathers. Humanlike ears contain tiny drilled holes which may have supported adornments. Such figures with protruding chests and arms bent at the elbow, drawn up close to the body, have been interpreted as human figures with non-standard bodies as a result of skeletal dysplasia.The avian attributes on the head could be interpreted as a complex mask-and-headdress assemblage worn on a human performer, or as the fusion of a human and raptor as part of a spiritual narrative about transformation. Throughout the ancient Americas, leaders commissioned works to harness the predatory power of flying creatures. Avian figures feature prominently in Olmec art at small and large scale, such as the cave paintings found at Oxtotitlan, Guerrero, Mexico, that depict a ruler in full birdlike regalia. This figure may have been the personal deity of an Olmec ruler, perhaps later deposited in a funerary or dedicatory context, as indicated by traces of the pigment cinnabar.Further readingBenson, Elizabeth P., and Beatriz de la Fuente, eds.

Some figures appear catlike, with pointed ears and tails, while the others seem more human, wearing crescent-shaped headdresses. The unusually long tail of one \"cat\" seems to wrap around the neck of the seated figure below it.

Later that year, Voltaire's niece, Mme Denis, commissioned a lifesize marble statue based on the sketch, which had been much admired by visitors who saw it in Houdon's studio. The marble (Comédie-Française, Paris) was completed in 1781, but a small gilt-bronze example of the maquette version, destined for the collection of Catherine the Great, was shown in the Salon of 1779. (The Russian empress also commissioned a marble version, still in Saint Petersburg.) Houdon's studio went on to produce numerous replicas of this sketch model, of which the Museum's example, which features the sculptor's atelier seal on its back, is one.The contrast between the two subtly different versions—the sketch from life and the tuned-up final conception—is fascinating and instructive, revealing precisely how the artist adjusted \"reality\" to produce an immortal image. The initial maquette is more passive, less alert than the large versions; it shows the bald-pated philosopher seated upright with left hand resting inertly on the chair arm and both feet aligned. One contemporary contextual_sentences emphasizes its naturalistic, domestic quality: \"This is precisely the old man of Ferney. . . . shrouded in his dressing gown, tired, ready for bed . . .\"In comparison to the maquette, the larger sculpture was subtly energized. Its head is slightly cocked to the side, the left hand actively grips the chair arm and the right foot is angled further back. A lower seat back and bulkier robe both lend greater monumentality to the sculpture, a graphic demonstration of the creative processes that transformed a casual genre sketch into an icon of the Enlightenment.\"",

Canvasses by Gaspard Dughet representing sea and air completed the scene. The Galleria was a popular stop on the　European Grand Tour during the 1670s.The frieze on the harpsichord’s case depicts the Triumph of Galatea, and the two figures represent the narrative of the cyclops Polyphemus’s unrequited love for the nymph Galatea. A small mechanical bagpipe that imitated the sound of his sculpted bagpipe would have been concealed in a \"mountain,\" no longer present, and played from the harpsichord on a second keyboard. This enabled a narrator to present the story of Polyphemus and Galatea with musical accompaniment. Todini’s ingenuity and multifaceted artistic expression sprang from the same creative climate that gave birth to opera.Polyphemus:Seated on a rock at the edge of the Ionian Sea, Polyphemus plays a bagpipe to charm Galatea. The instrument is similar to the sordellina doppia invented by Todini. The cyclops’s kindly and refined expression suggests that Todini was referencing Polyphemus as portrayed by Theocritus in his　Idylls, rather than the violent, enraged monster of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. This interpretation is reinforced by the gentle, winsome sound of the sordellina that Todini chose to represent Polyphemus. Although the eye in the center of his forehead gazes outward, his normal eyes are closed, reflecting the notion that love is blind.Galatea:Galatea is depicted here as the young, idealized girl who Polyphemus encounters in his dreams. Her arms are posed in a Baroque theatrical gesture typically used to express innocence and helplessness. She rejects the love expressed by Polyphemus through his warm, lyrical bagpipe playing, and is represented musically by the cold, austere timbre of the harpsichord.",

Expensive jewelry played an important role in betrothal and marriage, and the groom gave brooches to the bride as tokens of love. In 1447, for example, Marco Parenti gave his betrothed, Caterina Strozzi, a golden brooch with two sapphires and three pearls to be worn on her shoulder.",

Lacquer painting for book covers gained greater popularity during the Zand and Qajar periods, which also coincides with a gradual decline in the production of leather binding. The bookbinding here reflects the pervasive influence of European art on Persian painting in this period. Stylistically, the European impact is evident in the gradations application of color, the modeling of figures and objects, the observation of the rules of perspective, the use of shading, as well as the atmospheric effects.

Possibly a second-century marble copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor Leochares, the statue was immediately appreciated as a masterpiece and showered with praise. Probably once in the private collection of Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (later Pope Julius II, r. 1503–13), it was moved to the Vatican in 1509 and placed, in 1511, in the Cortile del Belvedere, from which it derives its name. Raimondi's print became an important vehicle through which knowledge of the statue was transmitted far beyond the Vatican. He is famous for his many engravings after the designs of Raphael, including images such as the Judgment of Paris (19.74.1), scenes that, like the Apollo, illustrate Renaissance interest in classical antiquity and mythology. Here, Raimondi's mastery for replicating the effects of light on marble produces a convincing impression of the statue's form. Many artists incorporated the Apollo's much-lauded pose into their own work. Albrecht Dürer reverses the position of the figure's limbs and Apollo becomes Adam, reaching for the fruited branch offered by Eve in the 1504 engraving (19.73.1). A similar figure of Apollo, whose outstretched arm grasps—too late—a fleeing nymph, appears in the 1625 marble group Apollo and Daphne by the Roman Baroque sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598–1680).",

Each panel portrays one or more pairs of birds resting on or flying around a blossoming plant, a tree, or reeds. Other species appear as well, including insects and the marine life seen in the fifth panel. Many of the motifs have poetic meaning and embody wishes for wealth, career advancement, longevity, and fertility. The symbolism of male-female bird pairings—such as mandarin ducks, known to mate for life—made such screens suitable for wedding ceremonies or a bridal chamber.",

    "title": "Handle for a Fly Whisk (Tahiri)",
    "contextual_sentences": "This elaborately carved ivory flywhisk handle was once owned by the Tahitian royal family. In the late eighteenth century, it likely belonged to the chief Tu-nui-e-a-i-te-atua who united Tahiti and neighbouring islands under his rule in 1791, taking the name of Pomare I. This handle was among a group of objects sent by his son and successor - Pomare II - a recent Christian convert, to the missionary Thomas Haweis in 1818. Constructed entirely of cut sections of whale ivory which are bound at three points with finely plaited sections of coconut fiber cord, it is missing several plaited sections of coconut husk fiber which would have attached to its lower end to extend below in a tail or 'whisk'. It is commonly assumed that flywhisks were used to chase away flies from the food presented to chiefs on ritual occasions, a misconception reinforced, and then perpetuated, by early missionary observers who were resident on Tahiti from 1797 onward. Certainly flywhisks were important ritual regalia reserved for a chiefly elite but this focus on their likely practical function eclipses important cosmological aspects which were an equally crucial component of their construction.Balanced on a wide collar at one end, a distinctive backward-arching figure infers a hollow space or canopy from which the central ivory stem extends in a series of openwork sections. The carving on each section is diverse, varying from angular sections with minimal intervention to more complex sections incorporating highly stylized figures that support each corner -- those with outstretched arms and legs give way to a series of simple incisions which indicate facial features on highly abstracted figures. Most striking is the largely uncarved tip which remains smooth, the final series of carved detail segueing into the creamy surface of the ivory.Coveted for its rarity, whale teeth (known as ivories) were particularly potent. Whales were deemed to be theata(shadow) or embodiment of Ta’aroa, the original creator god from whom all others derived. The bones and teeth of whales were therefore not merely symbolic or ornamental, they were relics infused with the essence and potency of Ta’aroa. Strong and lasting, they were hisiho(or essence) made permanent. The bones of one were deemed to be the bones of all and in this way, the flywhisk handle worked metonymically to index the entire chiefly lineage and all its predecessors. Serial canopies painstakingly hollowed out along the length of the handle were therefore intended as a highly abstracted, visual expression of fundamental genealogical principles.SourcesNuku, Maia. \"The family idols of Pomare\" in K.

This painting could have been inspired by an actual camel. Though not indigenous to the Iberian Peninsula, during the Middle Ages camels were brought to its Muslim-ruled lands from North Africa. The painters’ style prompted the flattening and exaggeration of this dromedary’s form, but its overall shape and proportions are relatively close to the real thing. Inside the church, the animal could have taken on specifically Christian symbolic value. According to Saint Augustine, the camel represented humility—a virtue suggested by this creature’s deeply dipping neck.The San Baudelio painters took inspiration from many different Mediterranean artistic traditions, which often came to them (or, more accurately, to their wealthy patrons) in the form of imported luxury objects.

A delicate parchment rosette adorns the sound hole. Two shallow drawers, perhaps for sewing equipment, fit into the top of the lid. Sounding an octave above normal pitch, this virginal was not intended for serious music-making, but the three octave keyboard compass of f–f”’ (omitting f-sharp and g-sharp in the low octave) approximately covers the range of women’s and children’s voices.Such instruments, fashionable in the first half of the seventeenth century, were a specialty of Augsburg cabinet and instrument makers. The instrument, having neither maker’s name nor the Augsburg hallmark, was probably built by a pieceworker for a distributor. The hallmark would have not been granted in any case, as the instrument is not made of solid ebony. Rather, the maker used soft blind wood and veneered it with ebony, and in some areas he resorted to black varnish to imitate ebony.Technical contextual_sentences: Case of ebony and dark-stained wood with two small drawers in the lid, the inside of the lid is decorated with colored paper prints, probably not original; compass f.g.a. --f3, bone naturals with fronts of key levers stained black, black stained accidentals with ebony plates, keyboard front rail, balance rail, and back rail are glued to the bottom, key dip controlled by padding on front rail, keys guided by wooden slips in rack; jacks are of pear with beech tongues, brass leaf springs (some are quill replacements), quill plectra, single flag dampers, and small lead weights, jacks are guided by punched leather strips glued to the soundboard and separate lower guide, two jacks share on slot, but a small crosspiece has been glued below the soundboard in each slot to separate the jacks; the soundboard has a small pierced parchment rose.

    "contextual_sentences": "This spectacular plume is one of the earliest surviving examples of goldworking from the south-central Andes of Peru. Hammered to just 0.3 to 0.4 millimeters in thickness, this plume has been carefully cut and shaped with near identical incised designs on both sides. The plume’s now broken shaft suggests that it was once worn as a headdress ornament or used as a straight pin for a woman’s shawl.The upper register of the plume depicts a supernatural, staff-bearing figure with both human and feline features, its head surrounded by ray-like appendages. The figure’s large face, shown frontally, is composed of rounded eyes, a snout-like nose, and a grimacing mouth with prominent fangs. The figure’s body, seen in profile, has been marked with various geometric shapes. Its hands, visible on the object’s proper left, grasp an implement from which a bird in profile hangs from its beak.The figure stands above an enclosure incised with complex iconography associated with ceremonial activities. The circle at the center of the lower register represents a sunken-court temple, with large feline heads flanking the entrance to the court. Within the enclosure are four spotted camelids, which likely served as sacrificial offerings. Outside the circular court, human figures shown in profile carry religious paraphernalia while disembodied heads, birds, and llamas encircle the court. A third human figure can be seen directly above the ornament’s broken shaft.Widely known as the Echenique Plume for its nineteenth-century owner, this object is stylistically img_urled to the Pukara, who are associated with a monumental site of the same name near Lake Titicaca in the southern Andean highlands. The Pukara, who flourished from around 500 B.C. to 450 A.D., employed highly sophisticated techniques for creating ceramics, textiles, stone sculptures, and metal objects. Scholars have proposed that the Pukara are the predecessors of the Tiwanaku, a powerful culture that later developed in the same area. Indeed, this plume may illustrate an early rendition of Tiwanaku stylistic traditions, as the overall composition, architectural imagery, and careful intricacy are comparable to those seen in later Tiwanaku textiles.ReferencesChávez, Sergio J. “The Yaya-Mama Religious Tradition as an Antecedent of Tiwanaku.” In Tiwanaku: Ancestors of the Inca, edited by Margaret Young-Sánchez, 70-95.

Renaissance screens, or rejas, were composed of two or three tiers of spindles hammered from solid iron in the lightest, most symmetrical of forms and cold-chiseled with decorative foliation. These rejas proved so satisfying a solution to the screening of Spanish church choirs and chapels that they long remained models for Spanish ironworkers (rejeros). The Museum's monumental reja, although closely based on Renaissance models, was commissioned by an eighteenth-century patron, Isidro Cosio y Bustamante, bishop of Valladolid, and installed in 1763 in the nave of the Cathedral of Valladolid, where it divided the choir from the high altar. The cresting and the gilding of the ironwork were completed a year later.",

The dull, bumpy surface of the animals, covered with light green pigment, contrasts with the smooth, burnished finish of the red-slipped chambers. The hollow iguanas function as whistles, their several holes producing a sound when the liquid in the bottle is poured out.

Winged profile felines are on each side of the vessel. These big-footed cats abundantly fill the space allotted to them. Their eyes are round and divided in half with one half white and the other black, a stylization that was widely used on feline images.Vessels such as these usually represent either large cats or llamas. A number are modeled on the shape of the animal itself, with the animal's body forming the vessel container.  The insides of both modeled and abstract vessels are often found blackened and sooty.

Strong colors and painted surfaces that simulated other materials were very much in fashion in the late eighteenth century.This hard-paste porcelain plate is decorated in a style that imitates Asian black lacquer. The painting is executed in two tones of gold with platinum highlights on a black ground. The abbreviated landscapes in the center and along the border reflect a type of decoration known as chinoiserie. These fanciful depictions of Asian scenes as imagined by Europeans usually include figures in oriental dress and exotic landscapes that have little basis in reality. Chinoiserie scenes, however, embodied the mystique and allure of the Far East for Europeans in the eighteenth century, and were popular as a category of decoration for furniture, wall paneling, and silver, as well as ceramics.[Jeffrey H.

The chasuble's embroidered decoration-a nearly symmetrical pattern of full-blown, seminaturalistic flowers, small blossoms, curving leaves, and scrolls—is an excellent example of the style of late Baroque ornament used to embellish Italian vestments from the end of the seventeenth century to the middle years of the eighteenth. The robust flowers, worked in long and short stitches, French knots, and metallic loops, are carefully modeled in four to five shades of silk. The metallic thread is primarily used in laid and couched work, cursively following the contours of the motifs and secured in twill or chevron patterns with yellow silk. Although it is often impossible to identify the specific place of manufacture of such embroideries, documentation accompanying this gift proposes western Sicily.

It was a tradition based on the use of camelid hair, here probably alpaca, with a design program of small scale repeated elements, and strong color of closely related hue. Two shades of red, a dark blue, and a dark green, were used here, all of which are well set off by a gleaming white.The Chuquibamba textile style has only recently been distinguished from the larger body of Inca work, and women's dresses isolated from among other large rectangular pieces that have been called mantles.",

The Bayon, sited at the very center of Angkor Thom, was one of the last major monuments of the Khmer empire.This sculpture is fragmentary. The top head is missing. If the sculpture was, in fact, intended to represent the dancing Hevajra, it would have had eight arms on each side. Quite a few small bronze sculptures confirm this depiction. To judge from the rough surface of parts of this sculpture, it was never completed.",

At the left Saint Servatius, bishop of Tongres, holds a key presented to him by the pope in recognition of his fight against heresy, symbolized by the dragon he tramples.  The antiheretical reference is echoed below by Saint Michael, who weighs souls and tramples evil.  The Virgin appears in a robe adorned with representations of corn or wheat, an iconographic type stemming from litanies of the Virgin likening her to a field of grain nourishing humankind with the bread of life.

As described by a contemporary, the fountain consisted of a white marble basin, in the center of which was a woman bathing, in white marble, and behind her, in lead, a black servant woman pouring water over her mistress from a gilded ewer (see 32.100.159) Sadly, the group barely survived its owner's demise (the duke was guillotined in 1793) as the fountain was heavily vandalized during the Revolution.Houdon originally proposed the group as an acquisition for the crown, which declined to underwrite the expensive project. Its ultimate sponsor, the exceedingly wealthy and politically liberal duke, who would later acquire Houdon's bronze \"Frileuse\" (62.55), may have been attracted by the cool and unselfconscious naturalism of the bathing woman's pose, or by the unprecedented sculptural portrayal of the black servant. At any rate, the contrast between the two figures, and the use of different materials to distinguish them, must have made an extraordinary impression on all who saw the group.Our solitary figure has been heavily eroded through exposure to the elements as well as human vandalism; restorations include the filling of bullet holes, replacement of limbs, and the addition of romantic ivy-covered stonework behind the elegantly classical draped seat.

    "title": "Saint John the Baptist",
    "contextual_sentences": "Juan Martínez Montañés was one of the greatest spanish sculptors of the first half of the seventeenth century. Based in Seville, he carved numerous wooden statues and reliefs that were painted and integrated into large altar screens called retablos (English: retables) for churches in his native region or to be shipped to the New World. His forte as an artist was the single figure, standing or seated, usually robust, naturally posed, and richly robed. Somewhat defensively, he gave his reason for this: \"As for the appearance of the statues when they are seen away from their settings by those who do not understand or maliciously criticize them, we say that once they are in their places they will be very effective, and if they did not have so much drapery they would look very insignificant when they were put in compartments at a distance.\"  [1]To modern eyes, his works even when removed from their original contexts have a powerfully sculptural form; but it is important to remember how critical the original church setting was in the artist’s conception. The Museum’s statue of Saint John the Baptist, a rare work by the master in a collection outside Spain or South America, illustrates these points. A mature man with a powerful physique, he wears a short brown tunic cinched with a rope around the waist. A crimson robe patterned with foliage and cherub heads is draped over his shoulder and partially covers the rock formation on which he stands and leans. His left hand rests on the rock while his right reaches across his body to point. This gesture was certainly toward a missing Lamb of God on an altar in the monastery church for which Saint John was made or toward the top of a banderole with the message \"Behold the Lamb of God\" stuck in the ground by the saint’s left foot (where a hole exists) and rising to his left shoulder. The altar of Saint John the Baptist (1635 – 37) in the Convento de Santa Paula, Seville, gives an idea of how this might have appeared. [2]  His strongly defined carved features include a thin, split goatee —  the rest of his light beard and mustache are painted —  a knot of hair over the forehead and long tousled locks, a creased forehead, and straight, subtly carved eyebrows. Made of Spanish cedar, the statue has held up relatively well over the centuries, although some fingers of the right hand have been recarved and the right arm rejoined. [3]As a physical type, John the Baptist is like other statues of the saint carved by the artist. The one he made for the retablo of San Isidoro del Campo at Santiponce (after 1609) is generally similar in pose, though the raised foot of the Museum’s figure makes the saint’s gesture more emphatic, and its face is smoother and not quite as eloquent as here. [4]  Closer to this one in its powerful presence and expressive face is the Saint John the Baptist in high relief on the retablo of the Convento de San Leandro, Seville (1622 – 23). [5] A dating of the Museum’s statue during the artist’s mature years seems to be borne out by these comparisons. Beatrice Proske assigned it to the 1620s or early 1630s. José Hernández Díaz preferred to date the figure to the first decade of the century, before the retablo of San Isidoro at Santiponce. [6]  He viewed the Museum’s Saint John as a striking and characteristic work entirely by Martínez Montañés, but Proske thought she detected the intervention of another artist in the sculptor’s workshop and described it as in the style of Montañés.Documents connect the statue to the Sevillian Convento de la Nuestra Señora de la Concepción, which was suppressed in 1837. In a notice published in 1844 that inventoried the contents of the monastery church, Félix González de León described one of its retablos:Under a big molded arch with pilasters supporting a cornice, on a high pedestal placed over the base of the retable itself stood the most beautiful figure of Saint John the Baptist ever made by the celebrated Martínez Montañés. One can hardly explain the beauties of the design and the treatment of draperies and body of this famous image, the honor of its author and its country. [7]He further noted niches on either side of the statue decorated with pediments and angels and filled with paintings of stories about the saint. Relatively modest by the standards of the time, the retablo must have been somewhat like those in the Convento de Santa Paula, centered on the statue of the saint. Martínez Montañés’s resolutely straightforward image with pleasing partial side views would have been well suited to such a frame. The emphatic gesture was designed to be read from a distance, and as the sculptor himself explained, the voluminous drapery would give the figure weight and solidity in the midst of such splendid decorations. The sculptor’s father was an embroiderer in the city of Alcalá la Real, and the son’s taste for richly decorated textiles must have developed early in life. Traditionally, Spanish sculpture of this period was painted by specialists other than the carver. This figure’s relatively simple painted patterns and colors only enhance the power of the carving.Footnotes1. Quoted in Proske 1967, p. 4 (translated from López Martínez 1932, p. 238).2.

To meet the challenge innovative techniques such as prefabricated carvings were applied, yet typically Russian features like the dual-tone matte finish and polished gilding were not sacrificed. The carved armrests on the settee represent the double-headed eagle of the Romanov arms. After her wedding the highly sophisticated Maria Pavlovna moved to Weimar, where she cultivated a weekly salon that included the poets Goethe and Schiller. Her ostentatious suite—two settees (the other is still in Weimar), a richly carved canopy bed, a fire screen, eight armchairs, two tabourets, and other pieces—was installed in the Weimar Palace.

    "contextual_sentences": "Situated along the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra, a crucial trade route since antiquity, the Lampung region of southern Sumatra has long been a crossroads of cultures and artistic traditions. Lampung's sumptuous textile traditions reflect the enormous wealth brought to the region through the trade in pepper, which grew in abundance. The women of Lampung developed a rich variety of textiles that included ceremonial forms as well as other types, which were used as clothing. Among the most visually striking Lampung textiles are the intricately woven tampan, small square-shaped cloths that were exchanged during important rites of passage. Tampan were owned and used by virtually every Lampung family to consecrate ritual occasions and to assist each individual as he or she progressed through the diverse ceremonies that marked the various stages of life. Tampan were displayed or exchanged at both birth and death, at marriages, circumcisions, and ceremonies marking changes in social rank. They served as the focal point for ceremonial meals, as the seat for the elders who oversaw traditional law, and were tied to the ridge poles of newly built houses. They were a sacred force that bound society together.Tampan occur in two regional styles and in two primary colors. Those woven in blue depict the secular realm, those in red the sacred. Examples from the inland mountains show stylized natural or domestic subjects and geometric designs, while those from the coast (tampan pasisir) display richly detailed scenes of ships and other motifs. Although tampan were used by all social classes, the ornate tampan pasisir, such as the present work, were a prerogative of the nobility.The fanciful ships that appear on tampan pasisir, steered with the exterior rudders distinctive to Indonesian and South Asian vessels, may recall the forms of large trading ships that plied the seas in precolonial times. Shown in cross-section, the ship on this work is a virtual floating palace. Within it, a single human figure, almost certainly a person of authority, lies in a cabin in the stern, accompanied, perhaps, by an attendant. Forward of the cabin, a helmsman guides the ship with a steering oar. In the central cabin, a group of men (identified by the presence of the kris [daggers], in their belts) play a group of instruments similar to a traditional Javanese gamelan orchestra. The crew appears on deck and the skies above and sea below teem with fantastic life. Replete with images of abundance and regal ease the work portrays an idealized world of opulence, beauty, and power.",

Throughout the 1840s the number of homeless peasants increased dramatically in France, reaching a crisis in the recession of 1847 and contributing to the fall of King Louis-Philippe in the 1848 revolution. Millet's singular image, rivalling Delacroix in its depth of emotion and Daumier in its graphic economy, probably represents Millet’s first treatment of this theme. He reworked the composition in a painting now in the Denver Art Museum.",

    "title": "Charity",
    "contextual_sentences": "This allegorical figure of Charity nurtures three children. One clambers up her blouse to reach her left breast; one she pins with one arm to her left hip; the eldest stands at her feet, twisting to look up at his brother. Standing calmly amid her wriggling brood, the woman looks down with a trace of a smile. She wears a laurel wreath on her long hair. Lifting her robe, which is trimmed at the hem with a rinceau border, she reveals sandals decorated with seraphim heads. In its iconography, this Charity is related to the type of statue that stood in the loft or gallery atop the screen that separated the altar of a church from the congregation and also supported a crucifix, or rood. The Charity carved in 1550 – 52 by Domenico del Barbiere for the stone rood screen that once stood in the church of Saint-Étienne (now Saint-Pantaléon), Troyes, has three children tucked into the folds of her voluminous robe.[1] Another example, carved by the Flemish sculptor and architect Jacques Du Broeucq between 1535 and 1548 and still in the collegiate church of Sainte-Waudru, Mons, is accompanied by two children, one nestled in her arms, one standing at her feet.[2]It seems probable that, like the two works just described, the Museum’s statue was once part of an architectural structure inside a church. The sculptural programs of rood screens varied in complexity. At Troyes, Charity and Faith flanked the crucifix (in addition to the Virgin and Saint John Evangelist); at Mons, the group around the crucifix included the theological and the temporal virtues. Called jubés in France, these stone or wood screens figured frequently in European churches early in the sixteenth century, but after the Council of Trent (1545 – 63) they were often torn down as obstacles to the newly desirable proximity between laity and clergy. This Charity’s fine alabaster with traces of gilding and its good condition suggest that the sculpture originally stood indoors and continued to be protected from the weather.Since this type of architectural statue is predominantly found in northern France and the Low Countries, the sculptor has been sought in that region. Not unreasonably, the French artist Germain Pilon (ca. 1525 – 1590) was first considered its creator.[3] To those scholars who attributed it to Pilon, the Charity seemed to have the courtly grace and mannered line associated with art at the court of Fontainebleau in the middle of the sixteenth century. Comparisons have been made with the sculpture of Du Broeucq (ca. 1505 –​ ​1584), who often worked in alabaster, a material abundant in Flanders. The stately virtues he carved for Sainte-Waudru in Mons have many points of comparison with the Museum’s Charity. Their straightforward poses are enlivened by drapery that clings to the torso in many fine pleats but sweeps around the legs in broader swaths. The Museum’s Charity does not have the broad, sharp eyebrows characteristic of the Mons statues, and her children have lumpier muscles and more awkward poses than the graceful wards of the Sainte-Waudru Charity. But its refined carving and keen formal sense suggest the hand of an accomplished artist familiar with Du Broeucq’s style.A third sculptor, the German Conrad Meit (1480s – 1550/51), has been mentioned in connection with this Charity.[4] Meit worked in the same region as Du Broeucq, particularly at the church of Brou, near Bourg-en-Bresse, where his Sybil, or Virtue, of 1532 decorates the tomb of Margaret of Austria. Its sweet demeanor is reminiscent of our Charity. The precision and geometric patterns in Meit’s carving of pleats, however, do not seem quite matched in the more relaxed flow of this Charity’s drapery.Recently, Jens Burk proposed a fourth candidate, Claudius Floris (died after 1548).[5] Dean of the guild of Saint Luke (a professional organization of painters, sculptors, and other artists) in Antwerp, he was responsible for the sculptural images at the top of the sacramental tower in the abbey church of Tongerlo in Flanders. This fifty-foot-high structure executed between 1536 and 1547/48 supported some five hundred statues and statuettes until it was destroyed in 1797. No images of the original monument are known, and only a few of its sculptural decorations, including some of Meit’s work, survive. Fredericus van Houdt, prior of the Norbertine abbey of Tongerlo, in 1779 described three fairly tall alabaster statues of Faith, Love, and Hope standing on a level above Meit’s statues. Furthermore, a 1798 inventory of works in the Carmelite convent at Antwerp noted an alabaster statue of \"Love with three children\" (\"Love\" is the literal translation of Caritas, the Latin word for charity), a hint that it may have escaped the demolition the previous year. Although there are no certain extant works by Claudius Floris, Burk’s research establishes circumstantial evidence that he may have been the sculptor responsible for the Museum’s Charity. Further research may yield proof of this hypothesis.Although the question of attribution remains open, it seems correct to say that this probably mid-sixteenth-century statue once stood on an architectural screen or tower at a church in northern France or southern Flanders. Whoever was the artist responsible, the sculpture, at once graceful and compelling, is perhaps the finest and most imposing alabaster carving of this period in an American museum.[Ian Wardropper.

He displays a number of the auspicious marks of Buddhahood (lakshanas): the extended earlobes, which serve to remind the viewer of the Buddha’s former princely status; the three rings on the neck; the forehead mark (urna, a curl of hair according to texts); and the highly pronounced skull protuberance (ushnisha). The presence of a flame-like projection surmounting the ushnisha is a rare and significant feature, for although it has a textual foundation, it is rarely represented in Tibetan or indeed Indian Buddhist art. The figure has a refined and smooth surface, with traces of gilding on the face and neck. Skillfully articulated fingers and toes add a poignantly human dimension to this otherwise rather abstracted and ethereal Buddha image. The subtle hint of a smile and the downcast expression masterfully capture the inner calm of Buddhahood and awakened bliss.",

    "title": "Portrait Head Bottle",
    "contextual_sentences": "Moche potters of Peru’s North Coast produced tens of thousands of modeled and painted ceramic vessels over the course of some six centuries between the third and ninth centuries AD, well before the rise of the Inca Empire in the fifteenth century. The Moche built thriving regional centers from the Nepeña River Valley in the south to perhaps as far north as the Piura River, near the modern border with Ecuador, developing coastal deserts into rich farmlands and drawing upon the abundant maritime resources of the Pacific Ocean’s Humboldt Current. Although the precise nature of Moche political organization is a subject of debate, these centers shared unifying cultural traits such as religious practices (Donnan, 2010).Stirrup-spout bottles—the shape of the spout recalls the stirrup on a horse's saddle—were a much-favored form on the North Coast for about 2,500 years, from at least the beginning of the first millennium B.C. through the early colonial period. The double-branch-single-spout configuration may have had practical advantages, as an ingenious handle, but it was also surely symbolic. As there was no tradition of writing in this region prior to the sixteenth century, however, the specific meanings of the shape remain unknown. The bodies of the vessels were shaped into a wide range of forms, including human figures, animals, and plants, and combinations of these. Such vessels were used in specific rituals; many, but not all, were ultimately placed in tombs.Portrait heads—so-called for their striking apparent resemblance to specific individuals—are a subset of this larger corpus of vessels. Their production was limited in time and space: they have been found only in the southern Moche region—south of the Pampa de Paiján, in the Chicama, Moche, and Virú valleys—and the most lifelike examples date to the later part of the Moche period, Phases III and IV (Donnan, 2001; 2004). Created with the use of molds—multiple vessels were made with the use of a single mold or matrix—the bottles were then painted with cream and red slip in distinctive ways. In some cases, it has been possible to recognize the same individual at different stages of their lives, from youth to middle age.The present example is one of several likely to have been made from a single mold, or molds made over the same matrix (Donnan 2004, 94). The other two vessels are in Chicago, at the Field Museum of Natural History (accession number 100076) and Lima, at the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Arqueología, e Historia, and they differ in the designs of the headband. The individual depicted here wears a head cloth over his hair, painted in a cream slip. He also wears a headband decorated with a geometric border beneath which are four undulating serpents, two on each side, facing each other at the center of the forehead. The profile serpents have open maws, revealing bared teeth and bifurcated tongues. The individual is depicted wearing face paint, including a bold cream-colored vertical stripe down the center of the face, with red detailing along the bridge of the nose and a triangle below the mouth on the chin, and two red stripes flanking the central cream stripe. Stepped motifs were painted on the neck, and just below the chin on the lower jar are a series of lozenge-shaped forms, perhaps representing pupae. Archaeologist Steve Bourget (2001:104) has suggested that these represent muscoid flies emerging from their pupal cases, a symbol of transformation in the liminal stages of death.It is difficult to state with certainty how portrait vessels were viewed in the past. Based on a comprehensive study of some 900 portrait heads and related archaeological data, Christopher Donnan (2001, 2004) has argued that they represented prominent individuals who would have been known by members of their community. Other scholars have emphasized their final contexts in burials, suggesting that such vessels are literal representations of decapitated heads, acts of reverence or devotion by kin (Weismantel, 2015).Joanne Pillsbury, Andrall E.

Found stacked together in tombs in groups of as many as seven, the Kerma beaker is the most common form of classic Kerma ware. The outgrowth of a long Nilotic tradition of black-topped red polished ware, these delicate, thin-walled vessels mark a zenith in ceramic technology. Their production required a highly controlled kiln temperature and atmosphere. Formed by hand, each pot was covered with red ocher and polished before firing. To achieve the black top and interior, the vessels were inverted in a combustible material to create a reducing atmosphere during firing. The irregular opalescent band between the black and red surfaces seems to be a glazelike material that was painted on before firing. These graceful, finely modeled cups, with their highly polished surface and opalescent ring, are among the greatest works of ceramic art.This beaker was found in a grave at the Egyptian site of Abydos. Classic Kerma ware has been found in a number of tombs in Egypt dating from the late Middle Kingdom to the early New Kingdom (ca. 1785–1500 B.C.). These tombs generally contain both Kerma ceramics and Egyptian goods. Although it is not certain that the owners of these tombs were Nubians, it is quite possible that they represented traders, originally from Kerma, who had taken up residence in Egypt.",

    "title": "Mirror-Bearer",
    "contextual_sentences": "This Mirror-Bearer figure is the best-preserved example of portable Maya wood sculpture and one of the highlights of the Early Classic period (ca. A.D. 250–550) Maya art. The artist created this figure out of a solid piece of hardwood from the genusCordia, known locally asbocote. Research determined a radiocarbon age for the wood of 1425 years before present (± 120 years), or a range of A.D. 410 to 650. It was said to have come from the border region between Guatemala and Tabasco, Mexico. Most likely, to judge from its extraordinary preservation, the findspot must have been a dry cave or well-sealed funerary chamber. The damage on its left side is the result of some wear or decay in that context, perhaps from resting against a surface or being subjected to varying passage of air.The person, a male, wears an elaborate knee-length woven skirt with ties that cover his navel. The waistband of the skirt shows a braided and fringed design with circular rosettes on the hips and at the spine. The hem of the skirt displays a jagged starburst-like pattern bordered above by a twisted braid and below by flaring fringe. The square knot at the figure’s stomach accentuates the realistic portrayal of the garment that sags between its slightly splayed knees. In addition, the Mirror-Bearer dons a shawl that goes around his neck and falls through his arms to connect to the rear rosette and is gathered in a bunch that sags away from the figure’s back.Clearly defined notches in the skirt and under the arms would have held a removable plaque approximately 5 inches square, probably covered in a mosaic mirror of pyrite or obsidian. The plaque would have been inserted under the arms and then hooked into the skirt notches. In fact, the artist thinned the shawl under the figure’s right arm by chiseling. This enabled a better \"fit\" for the plaque, which, at a roughly 60-degree angle, matched the pitch of the figure’s face.The Mirror-Bearer wears a distinct hairstyle or headdress and is shown with a curled moustache. The eye sockets are carved out, possibly to hold eye inlays of shell and obsidian. He arches his back, his head slightly tilted upward, his upper arms parallel to the ground, and his feet, which, though eroded, are folded under his body. He is shown holding his fists tightly to his chest, clutched under an elaborate pectoral. The pectoral ornament depicts an anthropomorphic portrait, with a headdress, ear flares, and a wide collar of jade beads. The elaborate multi-tiered ear ornaments of the figure consist of a flare through the stretched lobe, with two other jade discs hanging below it, terminating in a graceful portrait of a jawless reptilian creature. Such luxurious jade jewelry would have only been reserved for a high member of the elite. Surviving reddish iron oxide pigment on the surface indicates that he would have been brightly painted and vivid in effect.Although the artist seems to have depicted this individual at a small scale but with normal bodily proportions at approximately 1/3 scale, he is most likely a royal court dwarf, as seen in many palace scenes. The unusual facial hair, bulbous forehead, and profile are consistent with Maya artists’ depictions of individuals with achondroplasia or other types of genetic dwarfism. In Maya art, dwarves represented a type of antithetical beauty in contrast to the graceful Maize God. They were also very special in the eyes of Mesoamerican societies; they had divinatory powers and were sought after as entertainers in royal courts.The mirror-bearer to the ruler was an important role, sometimes filled by a woman, but more often by courtly dwarves. Their primary function was to reflect the image of Maya lords and ladies as those dignitaries preened in self-regard. Many of these mirror plaques have been found in Mexico and Central America, especially from the Classic Maya and Teotihuacan cultures. They are usually rectangular or circular ranging from 7 to 30 cm. in diameter. Mirrors are also known as objects for divination in Mesoamerica. The mirrors themselves were planes of luminous reflection, conceived as portals. The semi-permanence of a mirror held by a stone or wooden character implies that a mirror needed to be aimed at the ruler at all times when he was on the throne.There may be a connection with the wooden Mirror-Bearer and K’awiil, the Maya god of lightning, who is closely associated with mirrors or highly polished stones in artistic representations. When excavators at Tikal, Guatemala encountered a tomb they labeled Burial 195, it was flooded with sediment, allowing them to detect voids in the mud. When injected with plaster, the voids revealed small wooden deity figures covered in blue-green stucco from which the wood had rotted away. These wooden K’awiils are seen as holding a square elements in front of them, much like the Mirror-Bearer.Only two other wooden mirror-bearers are known. The first, in the Princeton University Art Museum (y1990-71), is of similar scale to the Met’s figure. The bearer is shown with standard bodily proportions but bears traces of an abnormal hairstyle and raised bump representations of scarification on the chin. Probably a youthful courtier, for young men also did much service to kings, he is adorned with a plain loincloth tied in the back and also exhibits vestiges of red pigment and stucco on the weathered surface.The only archaeologically excavated example of a wooden mirror-bearer comes from the site of Becan, Campeche, Mexico. It was recovered from a disturbed funerary chamber within the elevated tiers of Structure IX, the largest pyramid at the site. Along with the wooden sculpture, excavators found a conch shell (Strombussp.), a frame with mosaic tesserae of hematite, three obsidian blades and fifteen Early Classic ceramic vessels. The wood was also identified as of the genusCordia, perhaps chosen for its sturdiness but light weight relative to denser woods. Carved from one piece, the bearer is a standing male dwarf, leaning forward with his chin slightly raised and his arms held bent at the side of his body, which was originally covered in red pigment.There is other evidence that the Mirror-Bearer of the Metropolitan Museum would have been placed in the center of scenes of feasting, tribute, or other rituals. A wooden mirror-bearer may appear on a cylinder vessel in the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra (NGA 82.2292), originally made in the mid-8th century at the Ik’ kingdom of the area of Lake Petén Itza, Petén, Guatemala. The central figure is a portly king surrounded by his attendants, musicians, and even a hunchback and a dwarf drinking out of a large bowl. The key figure of this composition is the small dwarf holding the mirror: this is possibly an object of wood. It has a markedly differential color and scale that contrast with that of the nearby drinking dwarf, and resemble more closely that of the wooden mirror bearers from the Metropolitan. Though painted roughly two centuries after the creation of the Metropolitan’s Mirror-Bearer, this object appears in the company of other courtiers. Thus there was continuity through generations of portraying a wooden object in a group of humans as an equal participant in courtly life, gesturing and interacting with the king.James Doyle, 2016ReferencesAlonso Olivera, Alejandra, and Khôi Tran.Nueva tecnología aplicada a la restauración y estudio de una escultura arqueológica de madera.

    "title": "Vessel with mythological scene",
    "contextual_sentences": "This small drinking cup with stepped tripod supports features one of the most masterfully painted, well-preserved mythological scenes found on a Maya vessel. Because of the calligraphic line’s resemblance to that found in the three Maya books known as codices (sing. codex), this class of painted vases are referred to as \"codex-style.\" Only four Maya codices have survived from what was certainly a large corpus, but these codex-style vessels afford a glimpse into the rich world of painted narratives and complex Maya mythologies about agricultural cycles. The subject of this particular vessel is a myth pertaining to the start of the tropical rainy season.The black-on-cream painted scene, framed by vivid red bands on the flaring rim and the base, centers on an anthropomorphic feline marked with dark spots. This \"water lily jaguar,\" a character known from other depictions and hieroglyphic texts, crouches on a large image of an animate mountain, known aswitzin various Mayan languages. The jaguar wears a white cape and delicate vegetation sprouts from both his head and front paw.To the jaguar’s right, Chahk, the ancient Maya rain god, wields a large axe marked with the hieroglyphic symbol for shiny objects in his left hand, and an animate stone object in the shape of a skull in his right. He actively addresses the jaguar on the mountain, perhaps in a menacing attack, or perhaps in a celebratory dance. Chahk is shown with his typical knotted hair and vegetal headdress, marine shell earrings, a pectoral perhaps made of knotted cords, and fish-like mouth with one projecting frontal tooth. Furthermore, the hieroglyphic text specifies that this is the Chahk of the \"First Rain,\" setting the scene in the start of the rainy season of the Maya Lowlands from May to June. Rather than shrinking down the characters to show their full bodies, the artist chose to cut off the depictions at the waist. A smudgy border on the bottom of the scene may denote the fact that this action takes place in a smoky or watery location, possibly a low-lying area flooded by the early rains.The other personage to the left of the water lily jaguar is a dancing death god, who interacts with a supernatural serpent emerging from the mountain. This death deity is depicted as both skeletal, with a humanoid cranium topped with two extruded eyeballs and black face paint, and insect-like, with the torso segmented like the body of a centipede and a similarly segmented headdress element. He raises his hands as if to beseech or threaten the jaguar, who faces him. A tasseled jewel emerges from the death god’s nostril, representing an actual nose ornament, or perhaps representing breath. A hieroglyphic caption directly to the left of this character’s body likely contains a logogram for his name (the damaged glyphic head with black face paint) and states that \"it is hiswahy,\" or co-essence. This phrase of wahy possession likely refers to the vessel’s owner, who some have argued was a royal youth, although the child’s specific dynasty is not explicitly named. Thesewahybeings are often personifications of death, disease, and other unsavory aspects of the Maya cosmos. With its blackened eyes, this particular being might be related to the anthropomorphic deityAkan, associated with decapitation and drunken abandon.The scene here is not fully understood, but represents one variation of a theme depicted on several other codex-style vessels in public and private collections. Sometimes the rain god is shown with a human face, sometimes the death god has the distended belly of a corpse, and sometimes the anthropomorphic jaguar is shown as an infant on its back, such as in the Metropolitan Museum’s \"Baby Jaguar\" vessel (1978.412.206). In other scenes the protagonists are accompanied by creatures of the night, such as fireflies, toads, dogs, or other deities. The artists painting these vases might be showing different scenes in a larger narrative, or the same scene depicted in very different ways.The function of this small cup would have been to hold an individual serving of a maize-based beverage or a chocolate drink. Most codex-style pots are found as offerings in funerary contexts, including an example from Tomb 1 excavated at the site of Calakmul, Campeche, Mexico. Recent work at Calakmul has revealed many codex-style fragments of popular themes, such as the one shown here, scenes of the rebirth of the maize god, and various activities of other aged gods that represent ancestral characters.Further ReadingBarrois, Ramzy R. and Alexandre Tokovinine2005 El inframundo y el mundo celestial en el Juego de Pelota Maya.

In the drawing as in the painting, the use of diagonals that lead into the space, the cropping of forms, the agitated movement, and the visionary lighting all lend immediacy to the drama of the moment-and testify to the emergence of the Baroque style. A study for the effects of light in the painting, the drawing differs from the finished altarpiece in a number of details. The beams of heavenly light, for example, created here by wiping the aqueous white highlights with a sponge or cloth, were omitted from the painting. The drawing was first attributed to Ludovico Carracci by Françoise Viatte, although In her monograph of 2004 (Ludovico Carracci and the Art of Drawing), Babette Bohn has rejected Carracci's authorship, in favor of an attribution to Cavedone.",

    "title": "Stirrup-spout bottle with feline",
    "contextual_sentences": "As early as the beginning of the second millennium B.C., artists in northern Peru produced ceramics of remarkable technical refinement, aesthetic appeal, and iconographic complexity. By the time this vessel was made—almost 3,000 years later by the potters of the Chimú culture—ceramic production emphasized efficiency and repetition rather than artistic and technological excellence. Although Chimú potters used the forms, imagery, and techniques employed by their predecessors, their wares can at times appear mass-produced in comparison. However, some vessels, even though made in molds, as is the present example, are well modeled with carefully finished surfaces, implying a considerable investment of time and skill. The black color was achieved by firing the ceramic under conditions of limiting oxygen, thereby generating soot that bound to the vessel surface. The pottery was burnished after firing to produce the shiny black surface.This bottle depicts a feline crouching atop a rectangular chamber. Curiously, the animal appears to have a thin collar around its neck, suggesting it is a captive. The vessel has a stirrup spout—the shape of the spout recalls the stirrup on a horse's saddle—which was a much-favored form on Peru's North Coast for about 2,500 years. Although the importance and symbolism of this distinctive shape is still puzzling to scholars, the double-branch/single-spout configuration may have prevented evaporation of liquids, and/or may have provided a convenient handle. Unlike those of their predecessors, Chimú vessels are notable for the presence of a lug at the junction of the spout and stirrup. Here, there is a small monkey; others have a bird or a simple lug.References and Further Readingde Lavalle, José Antonio. Culturas precolombinas: Chimú. Colección Arte y Tesoros del Perú.

Ugo seems to have drawn inspiration from the wash drawings of Parmigianino, with whom he may have collaborated. The print shows the Greek philosopher Diogenes immersed in his studies.

In Chinese art, pine trees have long been emblems of survival. By representing them here, Zhao may be referring to his own political survival under the Mongol occupation, as well as to the endurance of Chinese culture under foreign rule.",

    "title": "The Assumption of the Virgin",
    "contextual_sentences": "The Neapolitan late-Baroque master Francesco de Mura executed three major ceiling paintings representing the Assumption of the Virgin, all of them strongly influenced by the example of his great master Francesco Solimena (1656-1747). The first of these was an Assumption painted about 1727 on the vault of the sacristy of the Annunziata in Airola, near Benevento for which an oil sketch is in the Pio Monte della Misericordia, Naples. In 1737 De Mura signed and dated a ceiling painting on canvas destined for a church in Gallipoli and now in the episcopal palace of that city. Domenica Pasculli Ferrara cites three oil sketches for the Gallipoli Assumption. In 1986 Lawrence Turčic identified a pen and wash drawing by De Mura in the Louvre as a study for the Gallipoli picture; the Louvre drawing had been classified as a work of the studio of Francesco Solimena (Inv. 9787-1, see Monbeig Goguel and Vitzthum 1967, no. 83).The most ambitious Assumption of the Virgin by De Mura is that painted in 1751 on the ceiling of the Nunziatella in Naples (see Enggass 1964, fig. 7). An oil sketch for this fresco is preserved in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples, and a presumably autograph replica of the Capodimonte sketch is in the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto (see Enggass 1964, fig. 8). The Museum’s drawing may be an early preparation for the monumental Nunziatella fresco. There are, however, notable differences between the drawing and the fresco. The apparition of the Holy Trinity at the summit of the painting is lacking in the drawing, where there are fewer figures in the foreground. In the drawing the setting is architectural, while in the fresco the background is a landscape. There are also differences in the shape of the field.",

Riding a horse, whose rich trappings are emblazoned with the arms of the house of Hapsburg, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (1500 – 1558) leads his retinue across a bridge with laurel-crowned Emperor Maximilian I (1459 – 1519) at his side (symbolically, since Maximilian was recently deceased). Prints and medallions have aided in the identification of other figures. Standing behind the two emperors is Maximilian’s court jester Kunz von der Rosen; Count Palatine Frederick II rides the horse emerging from the gateway of the bridge tower; and Willibald Pirkheimer, the Nuremburg humanist and friend of artist Albrecht Dürer, strides among the equestriennes to the right of the tower.[1] In contrast with the orderly procession on the bridge, horsemen and knights struggle to survive in the raging currents of the river below. The rebellious Reformation leader Franz von Sickingen is one of those who have plunged into the river. On the hills beyond the bridge at left, bowmen emerge from a tent to witness a joust, while on the right riverbank, men and women carouse at a banquet.Several scholars have offered historical interpretations of the scene. Karl Giehlow suggested, for example, that the Turkish knight emerging from a tent is a reference to the conquest of Belgrade in 1521 by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, who continued to threaten the east European kingdoms in the year the relief was carved.[2] Georg Habich saw a theme of imperial triumph over insurgency in the scene, citing the rebellion of German Imperial Knights in Augsburg in 1522, a revolt that would be quelled, however, only in the following year with their deaths.[3] Philipp Maria Halm focused instead on the inscription reading \"A Sketch of Virtues and Vices\" prominent on the tower at the exact center of the relief.[4] For him, the inscription underscored the allegorical nature of the scene, and the date 1522 included in it simply referred to the year the sculptor completed his task. Halm related the relief to a woodcut by the German printmaker Georg Pencz, dated about 1530, and to a poem by the Meistersinger Hans Sachs, dated exactly 1530, both of which concern the climax of the story of King Arthur and the Adulterers’ Bridge. In this tale the chaste king and his knights successfully cross the bridge, which lacks a parapet, while the maritally unfaithful fall into the river.In a 1956 article Leopold David Ettlinger reviewed these interpretations and others.[5] Asserting that none of the proposed historical allusions could explain the relief in its entirety and remarking that the story of King Arthur and the Adulterers’ Bridge could have little bearing on the relief’s meaning because Charles V had not yet wed in 1522, he stressed the more general allegorical significance of the scene. Daucher’s compact carving, he said, relies on medieval and Renaissance romances, such as the tale of Amadis of Gaul, in which knightly valor and virtue are tested by crossing a bridge or passing through a narrow gate. The \"bridge test,\" in his view, is a secular retelling of the Dialogues of Pope Gregory the Great (540 – 604) and especially the chapter on the Bridge of Dread, which only the virtuous can cross on their journey to the next world. According to Ettlinger, Daucher conflated these traditions in his allegory of Emperor Charles V and his retinue, most of whom, it is gracefully implied, will pass the test of virtue, though some must inevitably stumble and come to grief. The scene vividly recalls the triumphal processions beloved of Renaissance rulers, in which their glory and their exercise of dominion over towns and vassals are celebrated.Daucher was masterly in carving fine-grained stone into detailed depictions of rulers, such as Emperor Maximilian on Horseback as Saint George (ca. 1520 – 25, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), and of religious subjects, such as his Mary in the Hall (1520, Städtische Kunstsammlungen, Augsburg), which capitalize on architectural motifs and clothing accessories to captivate the viewer.[6] Into this relief’s small format he packed dozens of figures, many of whom can be identified by tiny facial features and costume details, and animated them with varied expressions and postures. It is likely that he relied on a single graphic source for the basic scheme. The four-arched bridge with its central tower and the contrasting scenes of parading and foundering horsemen are very close to the Pencz print; perhaps both artworks depend on a single earlier design. In the desperate gestures of those lost in the river —  some upended in armor, one with arms raised pleading for help, others swept under the bridge —  ​Daucher’s keen artistic invention is most apparent. This relief was prized by no less a figure than the great patron of art Emperor Rudolf II (r. 1576 –​ 1612), who kept it in his splendid Kunstkammer in Prague.[Ian Wardropper.

Often used in ceremonies, the animals selected for depiction were those that played a role in myth. They served as cultural and cosmic metaphors based on their habitat and natural features.Birds generally symbolized the celestial realm and were associated with the sun, moon, and planet Venus; they were also considered messengers between the world of the living and the supernatural sphere. The bird depicted on this handsome tripod vessel, supported by the bird's legs and tail, probably represents a king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa) because of the characteristic fleshy protuberance (now missing) at the base of its beak. Although king vultures feed primarily on carrion, they will occasionally kill for food; they are therefore connected with human sacrifice in ancient Mexican thought. The rendering of the bird includes three significant human aspects: from its projecting \"ear\" flanges hang pendant ornaments; its talons are shown as hands with prominent thumbs; and its head is adorned with a pleated paper fan often seen on headdresses of Aztec deity figures. The contours of the vessel are well-balanced—the lines of the sloping wings echoing the angles of the legs—and the bulging chest of the bird is perfectly centered between its strong legs. The smooth, shiny dark red and black surface creates a pleasing contrast to the rough, matte texture of the head and feet.",

He spent his early years in Ghent or Antwerp, probably working under the tutelage of his father, the illuminator Alexander Bening. Simon moved to Bruges permanently in 1517, where over time he headed a large and flourishing workshop. Although Bening was much admired in his day and widely imitated, his artistic personality has yet to be thoroughly studied.This miniature painting has attracted considerable interest in art history as an early self-portrait of an artist. Bening portrays himself, spectacles in hand, seated before a wooden easel. The easel holds a drawing of the Virgin and Child; along its left edge, small ledges hold various painting materials. In representing this imagery Bening allies himself with Saint Luke, the patron saint of painting, who is traditionally shown painting an image of the Virgin - a subject that itself became a conceit for the self-portrait of the artist in the 15th and 16th centuries. Bening portrays himself not in the garb of an artisan, but as a member of the intelligentsia. By inscribing his work with a signature (as the son of Alexander) and a date, he acknowledges his talents and heritage in the distinguished lineage of Bening illuminators in Bruges. The illumination was probably made as an independent work, rather than as part of a book, at a time when autonomous miniatures increasingly came into production.

    "title": "Cassone with painted front panel depicting the Conquest of Trebizond",
    "contextual_sentences": "Purchased in 1913 from the Florentine dealer Stefano Bardini (1836–1922), this elaborate chest, or cassone, has long enjoyed status as one of the few fifteenth-century objects of its kind to survive intact and, moreover, to portray a contemporary historical event—the conquest of Trebizond, the last outpost of the Byzantine Empire, by Mehmed II in 1461 (for another example of a cassone panel depicting a contemporary historical event, see 07.120.1). This status has been called into question by a detailed, technical examination undertaken in 2008. It has now been demonstrated that so far from being intact, various parts of the chest are not integral and that, most importantly, the painted front may originate from another chest. This means that the purported provenance of the chest from Palazzo Strozzi, first asserted by Weisbach [see Ref. 1913], may have no bearing on the interpretation of the scene on the painted front. That the chest itself is connected with some member of the Strozzi family is clear from the emblems that appear on the end pieces, which are original to it: the Strozzi falcon or hawk perched on a caltrop (spiky metal devices that, when scattered on the ground, destabilize the enemy’s horses) with a banderole inscribed ME[Z]ZE—perhaps indicating another Strozzi emblem, the half-moon crescent [see Ref. Nickel 1974]. The inside of the lid and the back of the cassone retain their original stenciled patterns simulating patterned fabric, and the top of the lid is embellished by a gessoed piece of cloth that is gilded and tooled to simulate a runner of cut velvet (this motif is worn, the paint having been almost entirely lost, so that the design is barely legible today).The scene on the painted front is universally recognized as coming from the most active and prestigious workshop for the production of painted cassone in mid-fifteenth-century Florence: that shared by Apollonio di Giovanni and Marco del Buono. Its subject is neither biblical nor mythological, nor even based on a contemporary novella such as those by Boccaccio. Rather, it depicts an event that unfolds before two identifiable cities of the Byzantine Empire. Much work has been done identifying the places shown [see especially Refs. Paribeni 2001, Paribeni 2002, and Lurati 2005]. In the left background, clearly labeled on its walls, is Constantinople. An attempt has been made by the artist to suggest a number of the city’s landmarks and distinguishing topographical features, some of which are also labeled. There is the Latin church of San Francesco; the monumental column of Justinian in the Augustaion and the Egyptian obelisk (evidently topped by a crescent) in the Hippodrome originally laid out by Emperor Septimus Severus in the third century AD and further embellished by Constantine; the Hagia Sofia; the nearby sixth-century church of Saint Irene; what must be intended either as the Blachernae Palace or its thirteenth-century annex, the Palace of Porphyrogenitus, which served as the imperial residence for the last Byzantine emperors (the fragmentary inscription may possibly have been intended as [PALAZZO] DEILO [IM]PER[AT]ORI); the Golden Horn—the city’s fabled inlet that was protected by a chain that could be drawn across it—with western ships (carracks) moored next to the Genoese quarter of Pera, the walls of which are dominated by the great circular Galata tower, atop which the Genoese flag can be seen. Other boats in the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara may be either Greek dromons or Ottoman. Further back, on the European side of the Bosphorus, is the CHASTEL NVOVO (the \"new fortress\" of Rumeli Hisari built by Mehmed II in 1451–52 in preparation for the seige of Constantinople; its distinctive towers are still a landmark today). Across the Bosphorus is another walled city designated as LO SCUTARIO—Scutari, present-day Üsküdar (the name, Skutarion, derived from the leather shields of the Roman soldiers stationed there; it fell to the Ottomans almost a century before Constantinople). Then, dominating the hill on the right is the walled city of Trebizond (modern-day Trabzon). Located on the southern coast of the Black Sea, it became the seat of a separate Byzantine empire when it was conquered by Alexios Komenos in 1204—the year Constantinople fell to the crusaders—and was the last outpost of the Byzantine Empire following the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans in 1453. It fell to the Ottomans in 1461, marking the final demise of Byzantium. Although hardly an accurate depiction, it seems clear that for his depiction of Constantinople the artist was supplied with contextual_sentencess and maps, such as the one included in Cristoforo Buondelmonti’s Liber insularum Archipelagi of 1420 [see Ref. Pope-Hennessy and Christiansen 1980] as well as, possibly, drawings by that inveterate traveler Cyriac of Ancona and the reports of other visitors to the city [see Ref. Lurati 2005].Before the walled city of Trebizond is depicted a battle. An encampment of tents is shown on the far right, in front of which the leader of one of the armies is seated on a triumphal chariot drawn by two white horses. He wears a turban, as do other members of his army, including the troops emerging behind Scutari, and he points his white baton towards a gesticulating, bearded figure who, dressed in blue, wears the sort of cylindrical hat splayed out at the top that was associated in Western Europe with the Byzantine Greeks [see Ref. Lurati 2005]; he rides a black steed and is plainly either reporting on the progress of the battle or taking orders. Prior to 1980 it was presumed that the figure on the chariot was Mehmed II [see Ref. Weisbach 1913] and that the battle depicted the Ottoman defeat of the Byzantines in 1461—hence the designation of the chest as the Trebizond Cassone. However, as has been pointed out by Paribeni [see Ref. 2001], Trebizond was taken by Mehmed II without a battle: it capitulated without bloodshed. Moreover, a close examination of the costumes reveals that it is the Ottomans who are being vanquished (for the costumes, see especially Refs. Paribeni 2001, Paribeni 2002, and Lurati 2005). Clearly shown among the captives and those in retreat are members of the Ottoman elite infantry, the Janissaries, wearing their distinctive white conical hats with the top folded over. Other conical hats are gold, some with a feathered decoration (for similar Turkish costumes, see Cesare Vecellio’s Degli habiti antichi . . . , Venice, 1664, book 7, pp. 297–302). Their commander is almost certainly the turbaned figure to the left of the melee, dressed in gold, holding a scepter and mounted on a black horse. He is defended by Janissaries, one of whom turns around while pointing with his left hand. Scimitars are wielded by both armies, as are the distinctive recurved composite bows of Ottoman warfare. In front of the triumphal chariot five captives, two of whom kneel, are being presented to the victorious army commanders. The characterization of the two armies should have been enough to refute the common identification of the figure on the triumphal chariot as Mehmed II. And, in fact, a careful examination with the aid of infrared light in 1980 revealed an inscription identifying him as TAN[B]VRLANA—Tamerlane, or Timur (1336–1405), the celebrated Mongol emperor and commander who defeated the Ottomans under Bayezid I at Ankara in 1402 (Bayezid was taken prisoner). The battle, then, would seem to be Tamerlane’s victory over Bayezid at Ankara, but anachronistically shown against the backdrop of Trebizond. As remarked by Gombrich [see Ref. 1955], \"it cannot have been the intention of the painter simply to represent a Greek disaster.\" And, indeed, the setting of a battle that took place in 1402 in front of a city that fell to the Ottomans in 1461 signals an emblematic intent.In the minds of Europeans, Tamerlane’s victories assured him a place among the \"worthies\". As such, his image was included in a fresco cycle of famous men commissioned about 1432 by Cardinal Giordano Orsini for his palace in Rome. A number of interpretations have been suggested to explain the apparent anachronisms (see the thorough summary in Ref. Krohn 2008). One would have it that the figure is not actually Tamerlane but the Turkmen rival of the Ottomans, Uzun Hasan (1423–1478), who was known in his time as a second Tamerlane [see Ref. Paribeni 2001 and Baskins, as reported in Ref. Krohn 2008]. Uzun Hasan made a pact with Mehmed II not to aid the Byzantine forces and thus to assist the Ottoman conquest of Trebizond. How this relates to the actual battle scene depicted remains problematic, but it may be worth noting that the Venetians sought Uzun Hasan as an ally against the Ottomans. What cannot be doubted is the intention to conflate historical events, using the past as a template for the future by reminding viewers that the Ottomans—now a threat to Europe—were not invincible. Paribeni [see Ref. 2001] has indicated a pair of cassoni panels commissioned from the workshop of Apollonio, apparently in 1461, that illustrate the triumph of the Greeks over Xerxes’ invading Persian army in 480–79 BC. Given the date of the commission, there would appear to be a reference to the conquest of Trebizond, the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, and a hoped for reversal. At the Council of Mantua in 1459, Pius II promoted a crusade against the Turks. An army was assembled in Ancona in 1464, but dispersed when Pius died there on August 15. There were, of course, also mercantile interests, and Paribeni [see Ref. 2001] has pointed out that in December 1460 an accord established a Florentine commercial presence in Trebizond. The presence on the MMA cassone of the two cities of Constantinople and Trebizond would thus seem to transform Tamerlane’s victory at Ankara in 1402 into an emblematic prognosis for the defeat of the Ottoman conquerors of Trebizond.As noted above, the painted front may have belonged to another chest so that the attempts to img_url it with the Strozzi remain speculative. Moreover, it has not been proven that the chest itself came from the Strozzi palace, though it contains Strozzi emblems. Several Strozzi marriages have been suggested as appropriate moments for the commission: Caterina Strozzi, who married Jacopo degli Spini in 1462 [see Ref.

His facility with the etching needle, which he treated as a drawing instrument, is breathtaking. Loosely inspired by antique motifs, the Bacchanals depict playful scenes of satyrs and nymphs in the form of reliefs set in shallow landscapes, framed by the fecundity of nature. In this whimsical scene, a satyr and nymph kneel facing one another, each holding a child resembling the other, perhaps a pair of fraternal twins.",

The house was completed from Adam's designs for Lord Shelburne in 1768 and was a meeting place for Whig social and political circles in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.The central block of the house still stands at the corner of Fitzmaurice Place and Lansdowne Row, and was converted into a club in 1930, when the two wings were demolished. The dining room, or \"Eating-room,\" as Adam labeled it in the engraving for his Works (1773), was in the south wing (to the left of the photograph) and was bought by the Museum in 1931. Owing to exigencies of space, the long walls of the room had to be reversed when it was installed at the Museum.In August 1766, Adam submitted his bill for the design of the ceiling, which was carried out in plaster by Joseph Rose. The carving for the wooden doors and door frames, shutters and window frames, columns, baseboard, and chair rail, executed by John Gilbert, was finished in December 1768. The marble chimneypiece was probably carved by Thomas Carter. The oak floor of the room is original. The niches originally held nine ancient marble statues acquired by Lord Shelburne in Italy from the artist Gavin Hamilton, which were dispersed at the Lansdowne sale of 1930. The statue of Tyche, in the niche nearest the windows on the chimneypiece wall, the only sculpture original to the room, dates from the second century A.D. The other niches have been filled with plaster casts. The original furniture, designed by Robert Adam and executed by John Linnell, no longer survives.",

The jug is more extensively decorated with comparable motifs. All three vessels represent Cycladic pottery at its most precise and accomplished, and presumably they came from the same tomb, possibly at Phylakopi, the primary Cycladic settlement on Melos.They were discovered in 1829 by the British naval officer Captain Richard Copeland.

    "contextual_sentences": "Numismatists – the scholars who study coins – refer to the ‘front’ side of the coin, which usually features the head of a person or god, as the ‘obverse,’ and the ‘back’ side as the ‘reverse.’The obverse of this silver tetradrachm coin displays an idealized portrait of Seleucus I (r. 312–280 B.C.) wearing a helmet covered with a leopard skin and adorned with a bull’s ear and horns. Around Seleucus’ throat is another leopard skin, knotted in front by means of the beast’s forepaws. The reverse of the coin has a winged, fully draped figure of Nike (Victory) standing on the right. She holds a wreath in her upraised hands, apparently about to place it upon a trophy of arms comprising a helmet, cuirass with leather straps and skirt, and a star-adorned shield. All the arms are hung upon a large tree trunk, from the lower part of which springs a leafy branch. The inscription reads \"Seleucus\" and \"Basileus\" (king).The imagery of this coin illustrates the ways in which Seleucus, the founder of Seleucid Empire, sought to legitimize his new status as king. The leopard skin on his helmet and around his neck alludes to the god Dionysus, who, according to Greek myth, conquered India. Thus in evoking Dionysus, Seleucus puts his empire on par with that of Alexander the Great and implies a divine status for himself. Indeed, the horns on his helmet are part of a long Near Eastern tradition of representing gods.This coin was excavated at Pasargadae, about 55 miles northeast of Shiraz, Iran. Pasargadae was founded by Cyrus the Great (reigned ca. 550-530 B.C.) as the first capital of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. This coin is one of several objects from the site showing that it continued to be inhabited after the empire’s final defeat in 330 B.C. It was most likely struck at the Seleucid mint at Susa.",

    "title": "Clavichord",
    "contextual_sentences": "This instrument is one of two known clavichords made by Kintzing, who also worked with the cabinetmaker David Roentgen. It has an unusual feature that uses a second separate row of tangents that are activated by knobs on either side of the keyboard. When engaged, these tangent raise the strings and stay in contact with them. When the keys tangents are played the sound of the strings is prolonged. This feature is known as a pantalon stop and was inspired by the popularity of the hammered dulcimer and the famous eighteenth century virtuoso Pantaleon Hebenstreit.Clavichords were built as far back as the early fifteenth century, and perhaps earlier. This most personal, simplest, and quietest of European keyboard instruments was the perfect vehicle for music pedagogy, keyboard practice, and composition throughout its 400-year history. The action of the clavichord is relatively simple: the finger depresses a key which, working as a lever, causes its opposite end to rise so that a metal tongue (or tangent) hits a metal string, causing it to resonate. When the key is released, the string is damped. The clavichord is very quiet compared to the harpsichord or piano because of the inefficiency of its sound production, with the tangent hitting the string at the end of its resonating length, rather than in the middle. The tangent mechanism, however, allows a player to achieve a range, albeit narrow, of louder and softer tones as well as special effects like bebung, a form of vibrato, so that the clavichord was and is valued for its intimate expressiveness. Earlier clavichords were fretted, that is, a single string might be used to create several different notes, depending on where a tangent struck it. Unfretted clavichords, with a single note per string, came into use in the late seventeenth century.Technical contextual_sentences: Unfretted clavichord, C-e3, 2-piece ebony naturals with 4 scribe lines, ebony arcades, bone-covered accidentals, Pantalon stop divided treble-bass and operated by knobs on walnut keyboard end blocks, ebonized bridge, softwood case painted gold in 19th century and decorated in 18th-century style, decoupage ornaments glued on varnished soundboard, walnut (veneered?) wrestplank and right-rear corner block, hinged string-box cover with no. 7 (?) penciled inside, on later stand.",

The queen mother, or iyoba, occupies an important place within the political hierarchy of the Benin court. By protecting the health and well-being of her son, she helps to safeguard the security and prosperity of the entire kingdom. In light of her position, she is entitled to certain prerogatives enjoyed by high-ranking male titleholders, such as a luxurious palace, a coterie of attendants, and the right to commission sculpture in ivory and brass. After her death, a large altar dedicated to her memory is constructed within the palace and decorated with an assemblage of sculptures that celebrate her achievements and facilitate communication with her spirit in the afterlife.This urhoto is composed of nine figures upon a rectangular base with a square opening at the center. Motifs referring to her strength and achievements such as mudfish and elephant trunks with hands holding leaves, and those of sacrificial offerings in the form of goat and ram heads, appear on the sides of the base superimposed over an interlace pattern. Above, the iyoba is shown surrounded by a group of eight female servants. Similar to other examples of royal art from Benin, the iyoba's superior rank is communicated through her greater scale and the detailed depiction of coral bead regalia. She wears the peaked crown traditionally associated with her position, as well as a cylindrical collar, netted shirt, and crossed bandoliers worn by high-ranking chiefs. The female attendants who surround the iyoba carry insignia of the iyoba's importance, including circular fans and a sword and staff of authority. Two young women stand on either side of the queen mother to support her arms, an arrangement also assumed by the king when appearing in state. Behind her, a pair of attendants hold shields above her head to protect her from the sun.The unique crested hairstyle and abundant coral ornaments found on the attendants mark them as women destined for marriage to the king or other major political figures. Raised in the palace by the iyoba herself, their sophistication and education make them valuable partners for powerful courtiers.",

The terminals take the form of an ivy or grape leaf and have a border of beaded wire and a rosette in the center. Strap necklaces have been found in many areas of the Greek world, including southern Italy, Asia Minor, and the Northern Pontus region (around the Black Sea).The superb gold earrings, dated circa 330-300 B.C., consist of a large honeysuckle  palmette below which hangs a finely worked three-dimensional figure of the Trojan prince Ganymede in the clutches of Zeus, who has assumed the guise of an eagle. Zeus coveted Ganymede for his beauty, and carried him off to Mount Olympos to be a cupbearer for the gods. The pendants are sculptural masterpieces in miniature, no doubt reflecting in their basic conception a famous large-scale bronze group of the same subject, made by Leochares in the first half of the fourth century B.C. The airborne theme is ingeniously adapted here to an object that hangs freely in space.The rock-crystal hoops of the bracelets (ca. 330-300 B.C.) have been carefully cut, carved, and polished to produce a twisted appearance, highlighted by wire bindings fitted into the valleys. The rams' heads emerge from long elaborate collars decorated with three friezes enclosed within bands of darts and bordered by plain beaded wire. The upper frieze, an ivy chain on a vine, is tied at the center with a Herakles knot and bears four bunches of grapes; the middle frieze has palmettes with pointed leaves; the third frieze, a palmette complex.The two pairs of gold fibulae, of Macedonian-type, date to 330-300 B.C. Such fibulae (pins), which belong to a northern Greek type characterized by \"paddle-wheel\" decoration, were usually worn in sets of six. Two more matching fibulae have been identified, one in Berlin and one in the Gans collection. Each hinge plate, all produced with the same die, is decorated with the head of a woman wearing a lion skin. She can be identified as either Omphale, the queen of Lydia, wearing Herakles' lion skin, or Artemis, goddess of the hunt.The toothed setting of the gold ring holds a fine-colored but flawed cabochon emerald. A similar ring was found at Derveni in a tomb of the late fourth century B.C. Emeralds first appeared in jewelry at this time and probably came from mines in the eastern Egyptian desert, though it is possible that some came from the Ural Mountains.",

Style was disseminated by European design books and fashion periodicals; the great international exhibitions, beginning with the London Crystal Palace in 1851; and immigrant craftsmen who adapted their skills and artistic traditions to the American market. Alexander Roux, a French-born cabinetmaker active in New York from 1836 to 1881, was an ever tasteful proponent of the latest fashion, working in the 1840s in the Gothic Revival style, in the 1850s in the Elizabethan, Renaissance, and Rococo styles, and in the 1860s, as here, in the Néo-grec style. Néo-grec was an inventive combination of motifs from antiquity, the Renaissance, and the late-eighteenth-century Louis XVI style introduced in France and popularized by Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, during the Second Empire (1852–1870). The form of this cabinet is derived from the Italian Renaissance credenza, and its ornament, with delicate incising, gilt-metal mounts, rich marquetry panels, and porcelain plaques encircled by ormolu ribbons, is an eclectic combination of Louis XVI and classical motifs.

Here the scene on the back depicts a procession of several figures in Spanish attire: two attendants follow an official who is preceded by two small musicians (one above the other) playing a trumpet and drum.The overall message, however, is still conveyed in terms of the dichotomous Inca worldview of balanced opposites: imperial order (the narrative processional scene) counters the forces of disorder (the Anti, implicit in the vessel's shape).",

Armless and legless, with faces reduced to essential elements, the figures are part of a larger group of works that have been called dolls by some, ceremonial or shamanistic objects by others. Most frequently they represent females. In Siberia during the nineteenth century, armless female figures were house guardians and spirits of illness; it has been suggested that in ancient times they may have had a similar role. The ivory torsos are known primarily from the region of the St. Lawrence and Punuk islands in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Siberia.",

The design of this chess set reflects the Indian influence in the introduction of the game to Russia, probably during the eighth or ninth century. Initially, the moves were a bit different from the European version of the game.Although the two sides of this set—Russian Christians versus Muslims—are not differentiated by color, it is easy to distinguish them and the type was a standard Russian design. As in Indian sets, there are ships for rooks and elephants for bishops. The king is seated on a throne. Also as in Indian sets, next to the king is his vizier, here represented as a Roman officer. The pawns are Roman and Muslim soldiers. The elephants of the Christian side have mahouts but there are none on the Muslim side. The pierced, ajouré bases of these pieces are attached with ivory pins. They are carved with Neoclassical acanthus-leaf tips, which helps to date this set.The town of Kholmogory, roughly fifty miles up the river from Archangel, was famous for its carvers, who used bone and walrus tusk for their productions. The sea mammal was landed in Archangel and every part of the walrus—the meat, skin, feet, and ivory tusks—was valued, for food and other products.",

For this portrait, she drew compositional inspiration from Saint-Gaudens's Robert Louis Stevenson (12.76.1) in such aspects as the seated profile position and the personalized inscription.

    "contextual_sentences": "Although engraved stones had been used as early as the seventh millennium B.C. to stamp impressions in clay, the invention in the fourth millennium B.C. of carved cylinders that could be rolled over clay allowed the development of more complex seal designs. These cylinder seals, first used in Mesopotamia, served as a mark of ownership or identification. Seals were either impressed on lumps of clay that were used to close jars, doors, and baskets, or they were rolled onto clay tablets that recorded information about commercial or legal transactions. The seals were often made of precious stones. Protective properties may have been ascribed to both the material itself and the carved designs. Seals are important to the study of ancient Near Eastern art because many examples survive from every period and can, therefore, help to define chronological phases. Often preserving imagery no longer extant in any other medium, they serve as a visual chronicle of style and iconography. The modern impression of the seal is shown so that the entire design can be seen.Several styles of seal-carving are known from the Kassite period. The so-called “First Kassite Style” hearkens back to the Old Babylonian presentation scene in which a worshipper appears before a king or deity, but is distinguished from this earlier style by lengthy inscriptions and abbreviated scenes with elongated figures. This milky chalcedony cylinder, carved with a single, bearded male figure wearing a rounded cap and a long fringed dress who stands before an eight-line hymn to the goddess Inanna, is a fine example of the First Kassite Style. The hymn beseeches the goddess to bless Nur-Shamash, in all aspects of civilized life (the “me” in Sumerian), for which she is responsible.Kassite period artists often drew upon the rich historical traditions of Mesopotamia. In this case, the long-dead Sumerian language and archaic signs were used to write the inscription. The hymn identifies the goddess as “Inanna of Agade”, a form of the goddess associated with the Akkadian kings who reigned ca. 2350-2150 B.C. The deep knowledge of the past exhibited in this and other works of the period demonstrate the interest of the non-Babylonian Kassite rulers in mastering the history and culture of Babylonia, already an ancient land.",

In the following year, Hunger was recorded as a partner of the Vezzi enterprise, and it must have been Hunger who provided the technical expertise to the factory.The Vezzi factory produced porcelain for only a seven-year period, and it is thought that less than 200 pieces of Vezzi porcelain have survived.

By allowing Prinsep's slight movement and by intentionally softening the focus, Cameron instilled a sense of breath and soul in this living apparition, for the true subject of her photograph was a poetic evocation of love and longing.  \"Maid of Athens, ere we part, / Give, oh, give me back my heart!\" begin the verses composed by Lord Byron as he departed Greece in 1810.

A small tightly fitted wig caps her head, and two holes with silver wires are located in the wig over her forehead; their placement suits a uraeus.

While nude female figurines have been for some time understood as requests for birth and rebirth based on texts on a few, new evidence has expanded our understanding, relating examples found in temples to the efficacy of rituals and magical cures and pointing to their identification with numerous goddesses. This magnificent figure might best be understood in relation to the important role of the God’s Wife of Amun at Thebes. In the Saite period she was the daughter of a king established as the god’s consort and responsible for stimulating his generative powers for the good of all.Purchased in Thebes, it is possible the figure derives from Karnak or from the burial of one of the God’s Wives on the West Bank.",

For the duke's tomb, his life-size portrait-effigy was placed on top of a sarcophagus, with figures of mourners rendered in high relief along its sides.  The idea of surrounding the tomb with such figures most likely derived from an early-thirteenth-century custom of attaching tokens of sorrowful remembrance of the deceased to his sarcophagus.  Here the figures may represent specific members of the duke's family.  The faces of the mourners are hidden by deep hoods, and their bodies are engulfed by the voluminous cloaks so typical of Burgundian sculpture.  The duke's tomb was vandalized during the French Revolution, and the mourner figures were destroyed or dispersed.  Of the original forty statuettes, only twenty-five survive, including this impressive example.One of two mourner figures in the collection. See also 17.190.389.",

Others have large, centrally spaced bosses, as on this example, and some incorporate complex figural designs. Metalworkers in Central America favored lost-wax casting over hammering for the manufacture of most of their gold objects.In the early 1500s, when Christopher Columbus sailed along the Caribbean coast of present-day Costa Rica and Panama, he reported seeing the Indians wearing \"mirrors\" around their necks.

The picture was shown at the National Academy of Design in 1836 as \"View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm.\" Cole's interest in the subject  probably dates from his 1829–32 trip to Europe, during which he made an exact tracing of the view published in Basil Hall's \"Forty Etchings Made with the Camera Lucida in North America in 1827 and 1828.\" Hall criticized Americans' inattentiveness to their scenery, and Cole responded with a landscape that lauds the uniqueness of  America by encompassing \"a union of the picturesque, the sublime, and the magnificent.\" Although often ambiguous about the subjugation of the land, here the artist juxtaposes untamed wilderness and pastoral settlement to emphasize the possibilities of the national landscape,  pointing to the future prospect of the American nation. Cole's unequivocal construction and composition of the scene, charged with moral significance, is reinforced by his depiction of himself in the middle distance, perched on a promontory painting the Oxbow.

Although characterized as more provincial in style than porcelain, French faience was used at the court of Louis XIV as part of elaborate meals and displays, with large-scale vessels incorporated into the Baroque garden designs of Versailles. Earlier examples of French faience attest to the strong influence of maiolica artists from Italy. Later works demonstrate the ways in which cities such as Nevers, Rouen, Lyon, Moustiers, and Marseille developed innovative vessel shapes and decorative motifs prized among collectors throughout Europe.While faience can be created from a wide mixture of clays, it is foremost distinguished by the milky opaque white color achieved by the addition of tin oxide to the glaze. French faience is typically divided into two types. Grand feu (high fire) describes pieces that have been decorated with glaze and metallic oxides before being fired a single time at a high temperature of around 1650°F (900°C). Petit feu (low-fire) faience, developed in the second half of the eighteenth century, refers to a process whereby the clay body is fired before being glazed and decorated with metallic oxides and then fired again at a lower temperature; pieces can also go through a third firing. Grand feu pieces have a more limited color palette that consists of blue, yellow, brown-purple, and green. By contrast, the lower firing temperature of petit feu faience enabled both greater precision in painting techniques and variety in the range of colors.",

It depicts four different tulip cultivars, each clearly named (Boter man, Joncker, Grote geplumaceerde, Voorwint) and beautifully rendered to record the prized bloom. The sheet comes out of one of several watercolor albums or Tulpenboeken made by the Dutch still-life painter, print- and tulip dealer Jakob Marrel (1613–1681). Married to the widow of the German engraver Matthäus Merian, Marrel was stepfather and teacher of the well-known botanist-artist Maria Sibylla Merian. In addition to flower paintings, Marrel created at least six tulip books, three of which remain intact. Executed while he worked in Utrecht during the late 1630s and early 1640s, his tulip books coincide with the period when the Dutch developed a true passion for the tulip. Known as Tulipomania, the rage for this flower, especially in its variegated or multistriped form, resulted in wild speculation, ending in 1637 with the crash of the bulb commodity market. Still considered Holland's \"national flower,\" the tulip actually was imported in the 1580s from Turkey, where it had been cultivated by the Ottomans from the beginning of the sixteenth century onward. It was the famous, widely traveled Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius (1526–1609), who, as supervisor of the Leiden Botanical Garden, was instrumental in furthering the introduction of the tulip and other exotic bulbs from West Asia, laying the foundation for Holland's modern-day global bulb industry.",

This design strongly recalls that of Indian \"palampores,\" hand-painted and dyed single-panel Indian cotton bed hangings that are often decorated with a central flowering tree. Chintz-appliquéd quilts were popular throughout the East Coast during the first half of the nineteenth century. The design elements, such as birds and flowers, were cut from printed fabrics and sewn onto a new background. The appliquéd pieces were often fastened down with blind whipstitch, but in some examples, more decorative buttonhole stitching was used. This quilt is a fairly late example of the chintz- appliquéd style, which by 1840 was losing popularity in favor of the pieced quilt.According to family history, Mary Malvina Cook Taft made this quilt for her trousseau. She married Horatio Nelson Taft (1806-1888), a lawyer, on November 12, 1841. After their marriage in Sag Harbor, New York, where Mary Malvina had grown up, they moved to Lyons, Wayne County, New York.The English chintzes used for the appliqués on this quilt illustrate the appealingly vigorous quality of mid-nineteenth-century textile designs. The central tree is constructed from pieces of chintz showing vibrant pink roses in full bloom. Some English chintz motifs, like these roses, appear time after time in American quilts. This raises the question as to whether certain furnishing fabrics were actually sold in small amounts of yardage specifically to be cut up for appliqués. The \"basket\" in which the tree is planted was cut from an English pillar print of about 1830-35, on which the column capitals overflow with a variety of boldly drawn flowers. The rather more modest palm trees that decorate the outer border can be traced to another English chintz, which was probably manufactured in about 1812. Either this fabric continued to be available well into the nineteenth century or for many years the maker's family carefully saved scraps of chintz left over from furniture upholstery and curtains.",

Of the six faces, only one is pacific; the rest are wrathful, fanged, and terrifying. All of the heads wear diadems of skulls, and the deity wears a matching necklace and a sacred thread composed of skulls alternating with lotuses.

These photographs are of special interest to modern viewers as a rare pictorial record of Carcassonne just prior to the extensive reconstruction begun under the direction of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc.Carcassonne's double walls, punctuated with towers, provided the photographers with a subject admirably suited to catching the nuances of light and shadow on geometric surfaces and one also resonant with historical import.

The region's dry climate has preserved Dogon works far longer than is usual for African wood sculpture, and radiocarbon testing of this work suggests that it may date as far back as the fifteenth century.Dogon sculpture is primarily concerned with the spirits responsible for the fertility of both land and people. These include a family's real and mythical ancestors, the souls of women who died in childbirth, and water spirits. While the exact functions and meanings of individual works often remain obscure, scholars agree that Dogon sculptures were created for shrines.The most distinctive subject rendered by Dogon sculptures is that of a single figure standing with raised arms. This posture has usually been interpreted as a gesture of prayer—an effort to img_url earth and heavens—and it has been suggested that it may represent an appeal for rain. This masterpiece of Dogon figurative art depicts a man with a well-modeled body in a naturalistic stance.

Ferdinand IV (1751–1825), king of Naples, was among those present for this solemn event. Married to the new emperor’s sister, Maria Carolina, Ferdinand was the brother-rin-law of both Leopold and Marie-Antoinette. At this time of social and political instability caused by the French Revolution, the Parisian marchand-mercier Dominique Daguerre and his business partner, Martin-Eloi Lignereux, traveled to Frankfurt as well. They were looking for new clients and lucrative commissions. This secretary (or its pair) and a matching commode were among the luxury goods they brought along with them and offered for sale. Mounted with Japanese lacquer and exquisite gilt bronze, both pieces were purchased by the king of Naples, who ordered an additional secretary and a matching rolltop desk in 1792. The set of furniture was placed in Ferdinand’s study at the royal palace of Caserta. Jakob Philipp Hackert (1737–1807), who as court painter to Ferdinand IV created gouaches for display in the king’s study, described the interior in a letter of December 4, 1792, to his friend Count Dönhoff in Berlin: \"Everything is bronze and lacquer, the furniture is from Paris, the room is beautiful and splendid and cost thirty thousand ducats with all the decoration, which is simple but precious.\"The lacquer furniture was the work of Adam Weisweiler, who stamped the back of the secretary. He worked almost exclusively for marchands-merciers and especially for Dominique Daguerre, who supplied Weisweiler’s Neoclassical furniture to an international clientele. The drawers of the breakfront commode, known as a commode à vantaux during the eighteenth century, are enclosed behind a double-hinged and bolted folding door to the right, and a single door to the left. The sculptural half-figure corner mounts and those of the frieze, which include scrolling acanthus and ivy leaves, goats, and playful infant fauns, add a nearly unrivaled richness to this set of furniture. Because of their outstanding quality they have in the past been attributed to the bronze worker Pierre Gouthière (1732–1813). They might, however, equally well have been the work of François Rémond, who is known to have cast, finished, and gilded similar bronzes for Daguerre.",

Luis was the first Spanish-born Bourbon heir to the throne of Spain and ruled briefly as Luis I in 1724. The armor is signed and dated on the backplateDrouar Ordinaire du Roi aux Heaume à Paris 1712(Drouar, armorer-in-ordinary to the king, at the sign of the helm, in Paris, 1712). The signature probably refers to Jean Drouart (died before October 1715), a royal armorer. Drouart was one of the last practicing armorers active in France by 1712. Remarkable for the state of its preservation, the armor retains its lustrous blue and gold surfaces and nearly all the original red silk lining. The gilt rivet heads are of heraldic design—the lion of León, the castle of Castile, and the fleur-de-lis of France—representing the dynastic claims to which Luis was heir.",

In early 1844, in an effort to encourage the mass production of paper photographs, Talbot supported Nicolaas Henneman, his former valet, in the creation of a photographic printing establishment in Reading, a town on the route between London and his home in Lacock. The firm's initial project was Talbot's Pencil of Nature, the first commercially published book illustrated with photographs-a milestone in the art of the book greater than any since Gutenberg's invention of moveable type. Issued in fascicles from June 1844 through April 1846, The Pencil of Nature contained twenty-four plates, a brief text for each, and an introduction that described the history and chemical principles of Talbot's invention. The photographs and texts proposed, with extraordinary prescience, a wide array of applications for the medium that included reproducing rare prints and manuscripts, recording portraits, inventorying possessions, representing architecture, tracing the form of botanical specimens, and making art. The publication, however, was not a commercial success, and as sales declined with each new fascicle, Talbot abandoned the project just before the seventh group of plates was made. Approximately forty complete or substantially complete copies survive; the Museum's example belonged to Talbot's daughter Mathilde.",

Similar images had frequently appeared in European heraldry since the thirteenth century. Rooted in the subjugation of Muslims and peoples of Arab and African descent, this imagery often signified triumph in the Crusades or involvement in the slave trade. Here, a white band tied around the man’s head is inscribed with three T’s, an acronym for the Pucci family motto: Tempore tempora tempera (Time alleviates all troubles).Thirty-seven pieces from the maiolica service survive (including four in the Lehman Collection: see also 1975.1.1134; 1975.1.1135; 1975.1.1137), all painted in Urbino by the celebrated maiolica painter Francesco Xanto Avelli da Rovigo in 1532 and 1533. Some pieces were sent to Gubbio to be completed with luster decoration under Xanto’s direction.This particular plate represents Aeneas and his companions at the tomb of Polydorus, a subject derived from Virgil's Aeneid, Book III. The bleeding bush (painted in red luster) signals the presence of the corpse, while the coat of arms of the Pucci family, on an escutcheon surmounting a standard, identifies the patronage. The Aeneas plate shows Xanto's energetic line and exuberant use of warm colors, often washed into one another—deep oranges and yellows against strong greens and blues. The richly decorated piece is made even more magnificent by the Gubbio luster.",

The hand is associated with action and productivity, and is considered the source of wealth, status, and success for all those who depend on manual skill and physical strength. Altars of this kind are commissioned in terracotta, wood, or brass, depending on the status of the patron.This ikegobo is an important historical document associated with the reign of Akenzua I. In the early eighteenth century, rebellious chiefs challenged Akenzua's leadership and threatened the unity and stability of the kingdom. Ehenua, Akenzua's ezomo or military commander, played a central role in defeating these forces and restoring order to the kingdom. In recognition of his heroism and service, Akenzua presented Ehenua with an ikegobo illustrating his military triumph.The artist who created this work, composed of a series of units, used costume, scale, and composition to denote the relative status of the figures depicted on the frieze. A monumental image of Ehenua, dressed in full military regalia and clutching trophies of war, appears at the center of a group of diminutive soldiers, attendants, and priests. Two rows of musketeers above the frieze include Portuguese soldiers, an indication of the degree to which European powers were engaged in the support of Benin's leadership at this time. A separately cast sculptural group sitting in front of these soldiers portrays Oba Akenzua in the act of performing sacrifices to his ancestors so that Ehenua will prevail and triumph over his adversaries. Finally, a carved ivory tusk, now missing, was fitted onto the brass peg between the soldiers.While most Benin art left the kingdom as a result of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, Ehenua's ikegobo remained in Benin in the possession of his descendants, who inherited the ezomo title. Its regular use across generations is a testament to its continued relevance and vitality.",

In March-April 1505, Michelangelo probably began the first drawings for the tomb project which according to a first (lost) contract, was to cost 10,000 ducats, was to be finished in five years, and was to be sited in Saint Peter’s at a location that was to be determined. Some of these intentions are already alluded to indirectly in Michelangelo’s letter from Florence to his friend, the architect Giuliano da Sangallo in Rome, on May 2, 1506, for it was Giuliano who had encouraged the Pope in his choice of Michelangelo as the sculptor of the funerary program, amidst the heated artistic jealousies of the papal court.As described in Ascanio Condivi's biography of Michelangelo (Rome, 1553), the tomb of Julius II was to have been a three-story freestanding monument and may have included as many as forty-seven large figures carved of Carrara marble, but Michelangelo’s project was interrupted by other papal commissions, chiefly the frescoes on the Sistine Ceiling (executed from 1508 to 1512), with which the early drawings for the Julius Tomb share considerable similarities of style. Following the pope's death on February 21, 1513, Michelangelo signed a second contract for a reduced version of the tomb to be finished in seven years. For a number of reasons, the Metropolitan Museum's drawing with its subtly pictorial illusionism of the architecture appears to reflect the first version of the Julius Tomb project, around 1505-6, as was convincingly argued by Michael Hirst in 1988, rather than that of the various designs produced after 1513, as has frequently been maintained in the literature. It is of much more subdued design and scale than the recto of the comparably large, nearly ruined drawing in the Kupferstichkabinett (inv. KdZ 15305), Berlin, which is the design most likely reflecting the contract of May 1513 for the Tomb of Pope Julius II. But the damaged autograph drawing by Michelangelo in Berlin is best understood through the faithful if awkward copy after it by Jacomo Rocchetti, preserved in the same collection (Kupferstichkabinett inv. KdZ 15306, Berlin; Fig. 1).To the present author’s eye, the appearance of Rocchetti’s design is that of a very clean copy-drawing, in which the underdrawing was the result of a \"calco\" method of transfer from Michelangelo’s sheet (Kupferstichkabinett inv. KdZ 15305 recto); in a process much like a carbon-paper copy, the original by Michelangelo was placed on top of a sheet with a black-chalk-rubbed verso and another blank sheet underneath (Rocchetti’s surface), and the outlines of the original were then incised with a stylus through the two layers of paper. Tellingly, the deriving copy is inscribed on the bottom of the sheet: \"questo disegno é di Michelangelo buonarota hauuto da M[aestro] Iacomo rocchetti\" (this design is by Michelangelo Buonarroti derived by Maestro Iacomo Rocchetti). The Berlin design by Michelangelo (as understood from Rocchetti’s clean copy) is also more subdued in design than what is seen of the lower part of the monument in the drawing at the Uffizi (inv. 608 E recto), Florence, once owned by Pierre-Jean Mariette and which is perhaps a somewhat earlier version of the design than the Berlin drawings while being from the same 1513 campaign.The diagrammatic clarity of form and precise construction of architectural elements in the large Metropolitan Museum sheet are typical of modelli (demonstration drawings), produced for presentation of the design to a patron or to be used for the execution of the design by members of the workshop. As may be deduced from the Metropolitan drawing, the massive tomb ensemble was to be a three-sided structure attached to a wall, and in a daring departure from tradition, Michelangelo designed the pope's effigy to be seen frontally, and within the tall arched niche, angels raise the dead pope toward the Virgin and Child. A quick outline sketch in pen and brown ink for the Pope’s raised effigy, seen in a side view facing left (Casa Buonarroti inv. 43A verso, Florence; Fig. 3), best allows one to envision the design of this main figure in elevation, as it were, in the 1505-6 monument.The upper part of the wall tomb with its monumental niche, or cappelletta, as it is called in the Julius Tomb documents, is of approximately the same design, though squatter than in the Berlin drawings and the architectural detailing is in a style closer to that of the Quattrocento. Also similar to the solution evident in the Berlin drawings are the motifs of the Virgin and Child in the mandorla (anticipating the design of Raphael's Sistine Madonna, Gemäldegalerie, Dresden, of 1513), with the dead pope in frontal view being supported over the sarcophagus by angels. But eliminated from the Berlin drawings are the figures of the youths with hirsute hair and somewhat whimsical expression who flank and face the niche in the Metropolitan sheet -- that on the left with an aspergillum and bucket of holy water, that on the right with a censer; in the Berlin sheets, these flanking figures are idealized and more schematic, while looking outward. The lower part of the Metropolitan drawing, however, most radically differs from the designs in the Uffizi and Berlin sheets. It omits the classicizing figures of the slaves and herm pilasters seen in the latter, and the nearly square relief at center offers an inventive portrayal of the Gathering of Manna (Exodus 16:11 - 36; Numbers 11:7 – 9), with acorns falling from an oak tree, in allusion to the heraldic device of the Della Rovere family (in Italian, \"rovere\" means oak). The Della Rovere acorns abound elsewhere in the design, filling a footed cup between two reclining river gods at lower center, and they decorate the finials of the thrones of the sibyl and prophet on the second storey of the monument. Allegorial figures of Charity and Faith stand within the niches to the left and right on the lower storey. The projection of the tomb from the wall is indicated by statues of standing figures seen in profile at extreme left and right, and the ensemble portrayed in the Metropolitan Museum drawing would have rested on a stepped base, as is seen in the Uffizi and Berlin designs, but which in this case is cropped by the lower border of the sheet.The early date of the Metropolitan sheet in 1505-6 is confirmed by the style of the figures, similar to those in the small pen-and-ink jottings on the sheet connected with the Battle of Cascina (Uffizi inv. 233 F, Florence); as well as further by the discovery in 1990, of the fragmentary designs for the Julius Tomb, on the versos of two corresponding portions of the same sheet now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, and of which the recto of one sheet depicts a nude seen from the back for the Battle of Cascina, began in 1504. \"The tragedy of the tomb,\" as Condivi called Michelangelo's forty-year ordeal in producing the Tomb of Julius II, did not end until 1545, when the present, much scaled-down structure was installed in San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome, far away from the papal majesty of Saint Peter's Basilica (Fig. 2); the most in-depth study of the related drawings for the Julius monument is by Claudia Echinger Maurach.The gradual reinstatement of the large, carefully rendered Metropolitan Museum drawing in the Michelangelo literature is due to Michael Hirst in 1976, who published the first detailed analysis of it, also advocating for the authorship of Michelangelo himself; the Metropolitan Museum of Art had acquired the drawing fourteen years earlier, as a work by the school of Michelangelo. While the attribution to Michelangelo has met mostly with approval since 1976, it was not endorsed by Charles de Tolnay in his Corpus (1975-80), who considered it a copy, with a style of outline-drawing too calligraphic, too soft, and less dynamic than Michelangelo's autograph studies, and the drawing was also more recently rejected by Frank Zöllner, Christof Thoenes, and Thomas Pöpper in 2008, without offering any reasoning. Hirst’s opinion in 1976 was that the Metropolitan sheet dated more or less to the time of the Berlin design (Kupferstichkabinett inv. KdZ 15305), but in a revised opinion in 1988, proposed instead the Metropolitan drawing as Michelangelo's original project of 1505 for the Julius Tomb. Michelangelo’s designs for the Tomb of Julius II offered meaningful visual sources (perhaps even normative ones) for artists of the following generation, as is seen, for example, in the design produced by Antonio da Sangallo \"The Younger\" for the Tomb of Pope Clement VII. Both drawings served as modelli, or demonstration drawings, perhaps for the patron, being precisely executed over a comprehensive construction with the stylus, compass, and ruler. While Michelangelo’s working drawing is in good overall condition, the design has been roughly silhouetted and mounted onto a larger sheet, and the drawing surface seems sufficiently abraded for the underdrawing to have disappeared in several passages; the sheet also exhibits minor accretions, a horizontal crease at center, and some brown stains.Carmen C.

    "contextual_sentences": "After the collapse of the Akkadian Empire and a brief period of decentralized rule, a dynasty ruling from the southern Mesopotamian city of Ur took over a large area of Mesopotamia, including areas in the Zagros Mountains of Iran, and ruled for about one hundred years (2100–2000 B.C.). During this period, a number of minor rulers maintained their independence at the margins of the empire. Among them were the kingdoms of Urkish and Nawar in northern Mesopotamia, a Hurrian-speaking area.Based on its inscription, this bronze foundation peg in the form of a snarling lion almost certainly comes from the city of Urkish, modern Tell Mozan. On a very similar piece now in the Louvre, the lion holds under its paws a white stone tablet with an inscription that names the temple of the god Nergal. Pegs of this and other forms were placed in foundation deposits under temple walls as a dedication to the god. Their appearance in northern Mesopotamia represents the adoption of a practice from the south.",

Vico conceived the artist's workshop not as it must have looked, but rather as a gentlemanly room peopled with industrious assistants in fashionable dress. Bandinelli himself appears at the extreme right in a garment adorned with a badge of knighthood, a sign of the rank he had received from Charles V.By equipping the studio with books and antiquities, Vico presents the making of art as an intellectual enterprise, and by naming the studio an 'academy', he associates it with Plato's famous school. The foreground is strewn with classical statuary and human bones appropriate for anatomical study. Brilliant lamplight and flickering firelight cast evocative shadows and illuminate the figures bent over their work. Some of their poses and groupings are reminiscent of Raphael's famous fresco 'The School of Athens', an analogy that further exalts the character of Bandinelli's enterprise.",

There were three generations of Kunimitsu swordsmiths who were active from the early fourteenth to the mid-fifteenth century, spanning the late Kamakura period to the mid-Muromachi period. Uda Kunimitsu was the first-generation swordsmith of the family and founder of the Uda School. Although there are a small number of surviving swords signed by Uda Kunimitsu, until the authentication of the inscription on thistantōin 1998 there were no known works by him that were both signed and dated. Thistantō, therefore, provides an important foundation for the study of the entire Uda School.The shape of thetantōhas a very slight curvature, with proportions that are wider and somewhat larger than a typicaltantōof the early fourteenth century, but which became more common later in the century.

    "title": "Julius Caesar (from the Heroes Tapestries)",
    "contextual_sentences": "The motif of Nine Heroes drawn from Classical, Jewish, and Christian traditions was first mentioned in a French poem in 1312, and soon became a popular theme throughout art and literature in late medieval Europe. Pulled from both history and legend, Hector of Troy, Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar represented the Heroes of the Classical era. Joshua, David, and Judas Maccabeus, from the Hebrew Bible and related accounts, constituted the Jewish Heroes. Finally, from medieval Europe, King Arthur, Charlemagne, and Godfrey of Bouillon formed the Christian Heroes. Celebrated as perfect embodiments of chivalry, the Nine Heroes provided exemplars of worthy warriors and just leaders for men of the noble and upper classes.French poems of the late fourteenth century also began to praise Nine Heroines. As counterparts to the Heroes, the Heroines promoted ideals of chastity, humility, and loyalty. However, this list of Heroines was never settled and artists depicted various groups of women from the histories and legends of the ancient world. The celebrated German artist Hans Burgkmair established a set of three Classical, three Jewish, and three Christian women when he produced woodcuts of all eighteen Heroes and Heroines between 1516 and 1519. Perhaps intended for his imperial patron Maximilian I, Burgkmair’s series provided moral direction for men and women alike. Four of these six prints are in The Met’s collection (see 18.20.1–.3 and 30.53.10).Dating to around 1400, The Cloisters’ Heroes are among the oldest surviving medieval tapestries in the world. Their state of preservation is remarkable, even though only five heroes are still extant. Each man sits enthroned underneath an architectural canopy, and each is depicted with emblems that early audiences would have recognized as clear markers of identity and authority. In its original form, the ensemble was almost certainly comprised of three large tapestries: one for the Classical Heroes, one for the Jewish Heroes, and one for the Christian Heroes. Made entirely of wool, these hangings were both decorative and practical, keeping stone interiors warm and festive during the colder months of the year.Since the acquisition of the Heroes Tapestries, scholars have suggested that they may have been made for Jean, duke of Berry (1340–1416), son of John II, King of France. Of the fourteen heraldic banners in the upper part of the Hebrew tapestry, ten display Jean’s coat of arms. Of the remaining four, three show the royal arms of France and one the arms of Jean’s younger brother, Phillip the Bold, duke of Burgundy. Tantalizingly, inventories of the collections of the duke of Berry indicate that he did own tapestries featuring the Nine Heroes, but these hangings—unlike those in The Cloisters’ collection—were made with gold and silver threads. Though we might imagine that The Cloisters’ tapestries closely resembled the ones in the duke’s possession, there is no conclusive proof regarding their original ownership.In this tapestry, Julius Caesar wears the imperial crown and brandishes a falchion, a specialized single-edged saber. A shield bearing a double-headed eagle, signifying the ancient Roman Empire, hangs from a spear at his side. He is surrounded by musicians and foot soldiers whose blue apparel and accessories mimic Caesar’s regal role. Originally, Julius Caesar would have been part of the Classical Heroes tapestry alongside Hector of Troy and Alexander the Great. Another tapestry preserved at The Met Cloisters (47.101.2d) most likely depicts Hector, or possibly Alexander; the third hero does not survive. The Julius Caesar tapestry is currently off view and undergoing an intensive treatment in the Museum's Department of Textile Conservation.",

Aside from bringing enormous wealth to the Akan kingdoms through trade, gold was considered the earthly counterpart to the sun and an incarnation of kra, or life force, and was incorporated into a wide spectrum of courtly paraphernalia. While the earliest gold weights from the fifteenth century displayed abstract or geometric motifs inspired by North African Islamic traditions, later weights from the seventeenth century onward were figurative in design. Some take their imagery from royal accoutrements, likely in reference to the Akan kings' increasing involvement in the regulation of the trade at this time.This weight represents a type of triangular amulet worn by the king for protection, especially at times of war.

The dense imagery, which includes emblems of both secular and spiritual authority, may commemorate the triumphal entry of the pope into Bologna in 1506 and the reestablishment of papal rule in the city.The back of the bowl is fully glazed and decorated with a stylized acanthus-leaf pattern. An unusually detailed inscription in the center, \"1508 adi 12 de seteb/facta fu i Castel durat/Zoua maria vro,\" establishes the object's precise date. This inscription is the only known reference to the otherwise undocumented Giovanni Maria Vasaro, who may have been the painter or, more likely, the owner of the workshop that produced the bowl.",

    "title": "Receptacle with Figurative Relief and Stopper",
    "contextual_sentences": "This hollow columnar container was most likely carved from the lower extremity of an ivory tusk, the natural curve of which defines the structure. The container has a hole at the top into which an undecorated circular ivory stopper, with an upright circular handle, has been set. Male figures are carved in relief around the surface of the container in two clearly demarcated registers: Europeans at the top, Africans at the bottom. The sculptor has depicted each figure in exacting and minute detail, paying special attention to facial features, clothing, and objects carried. Individuals are presented in a series of groups as if caught in action. Their placement around the tusk increases this sense of dynamism and interaction. Diminutive in scale, it is likely this container was intended to be held in the hand and turned in order to view all the figures. The majority of Loango souvenir ivories consist of a full tusk complete with a figurative relief along the entire surface, making this work unusual in the corpus. The arrangement of figures interacting within a defined space along a vertical axis is, however, consistent, leaving open the possibility that this might be a fragment from a whole tusk later modified into a container.The Vili are a Kongo peoples of the Loango coast who were historically celebrated as traders and sculptors, renowned regionally for their ivory carving and for the creation of potent minkisi or power figures. Carved by a master Vili sculptor, whose superior handling is apparent in other extant works attributed to him, this receptacle was intended as a souvenir for a European client passing through one of the numerous trading posts that sprung up along the Loango coast in the second half of the nineteenth century. These European settlements, located at the mouths of rivers and near natural ports, helped to facilitate the export of raw materials such as rubber, palm oil, copper, and ivory from the continent.Some dozen individual artists' hands and stylistic groups have been identified in the corpus of Loango souvenir ivories. Using basic European tools including chisels, sculptors drew on a wide range of sources material in these works, ranging from indigenous fables to European printed matter. As can be seen in this example, scenes drawn directly from everyday life in one of these commercial centers, familiar both to the artist and his client, were also often depicted.In the top register, seven well-dressed European men engage in acts of commercial exchange. A man wearing checked trousers, a collared shirt, and a flat cap, with a flintlock rifle positioned in the crook of his right arm, is seen handing over a dead waterfowl to a man in a top hat and coat. Behind this figure, and facing in the opposite direction, drawing the viewer around the surface of the ivory, stands a man with an umbrella in his right hand and a pipe in his mouth. He is directly behind a man dressed in a tail coat with a high lapel and large buttons. In front of this individual (now on the opposite side of the ivory from the waterfowl exchange) is a bearded man who holds a cigar to his mouth with one hand, a cane in the other, and leans slightly forward in conversation with a bareheaded man reading from a document. A well-dressed European holding a set of keys stands apart from the rest. Defined by the clothes they wear and the objects they carry, the sculptor shows trade as being conducted in an orderly fashion among European men of a similar high rank.In the bottom register, occupied exclusively by African individuals, a different universe is depicted; violent exchange is the defining principle. The main scene shows a man being forcibly restrained by both arms. Wearing a simple loincloth and with his arms outspread and head fallen against his chest, he is reminiscent of figures of Christ produced in the Kongo region since the late fifteenth century. His right arm is grasped by a bareheaded individual who looks away. His left arm is held by a man with his mouth open in an aggressive smile who grips a gin bottle, possibly indicating he is drunk. This man wears an mpu, a Kongo crown of leadership made out of knotted raffia or pineapple fiber, symbolic of his authority. Behind him cowers an indentured laborer, or slave, kneeling beneath the weight of the large calabash water container on his head, the basketry covering minutely rendered by the sculptor. On the side of the ivory opposite from this capture scene, another act of aggression is unfolding. A man wearing a fez hat with a feather at the back and an elaborate sarong with a checked pattern threatens an individual of lower rank, holding him by the arm and pointing a finger at his face.The trade of the dead bird between the two Europeans sits directly above the African capture scene, making a subtle equivalency. The European traders who lean in to make a deal are positioned above a confrontation scene between two African men. Although the sculptor grants the European protagonists the physical distance from Africans that they fought hard to maintain in these commercial centers of the late nineteenth century, the sculptor unflinchingly implicates them in the violence of the Atlantic trade, looking back to the transatlantic slave trade. Those who hold the umbrellas and the walking sticks, the guns and the keys, are undoubtedly those in charge. The Vili sculptor who carved this work, and who came out of a celebrated tradition of ivory carvers in the region dating back to at least the sixteenth century, sends to Europe an artwork that directly implicates the true perpetrators of the violence which he sees around him.James Green",

    "contextual_sentences": "It was Goltzius' poor health as well as his desire to see the treasures of Rome that inspired him to travel to Italy in 1590—91. Supposedly, the famed Dutch printmaker traveled incognito in order to avoid social obligations that might distract from his real purpose, which was sketching and studying antique sculptures. The ancient Roman statue known as the Farnese Hercules had been discovered in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome in 1546, and installed in a courtyard of the Farnese family's palace on the banks of the Tiber, where it was one of the highlights of the Roman tour for visiting scholars, connoisseurs, and artists. When Goltzius drew the statue, the legs he saw were substitutions that had been made by Guglielmo della Porta in 1560—although the ancient legs had been found soon after the rest of the statue, Michelangelo convinced the Farnese that the modern ones were just as good.The two figures looking up at the massive statue in the lower right corner of the engraving have never been satisfactorily identified. Perhaps, as was suggested by the eighteenth-century Dutch artist and collector Cornelis Ploos van Amstel, they are a self-portrait and a portrait of the artist's stepson Jacob Matham, who was also an engraver.The Farnese Hercules shows to excellent advantage the virtuosic technique that Goltzius had developed, in which the swelling and tapering line pioneered by Cornelis Cort is exaggerated to the point that it becomes a focus of interest in itself. As the line winds around the forms, expanding and contracting, it gives great sculptural force to the curves and bulges of the hero's body. The engraving by Goltzius, unusual for its viewpoint and its inclusion of observers, was one of a long series that had spread the fame of the statue, including one by Jacob Bos (41.72[2.63]) that provides the more common front view of the Hercules.",

In May, they sat for Saint-Gaudens in Paris for this family portrait, the sculptor's first multifigure relief. Gilder (1844–1909) was a close friend of Saint-Gaudens and an intimate of New York's genteel circle. He used his position at Scribner's Monthly and, after 1881, as editor of Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine to proselytize for younger, French-trained, American sculptors, Saint-Gaudens being his favorite.

Close examination reveals that the two figures do not quite touch each other—this elusive grasp adds erotic tension as well as pathos to the subject.Although this is a legitimate mythological subject, with considerable narrative interest, it is generally thought to belong to the set of fifteen small engravings characterized by suggestive subjects—ranging from groupings of attractive nudes to genuinely lewd depictions—and known as the Lascivie. This series of engravings, of Agostino's own invention, were carried out in a different technique from his reproductive prints, and instead resemble quickly executed pen sketches. Eight copies after of the Orpheus and Eurydice are known, suggesting that this was the most popular of the Lascivie series.",

The letters and accounts written by Heqanakht and one or more scribes on sheets of papyrus were discovered by Museum excavator Herbert E. Winlock in the excavation season of 1921-1922 in the tomb of Meseh, who had a side passage and crypt in the tomb complex of the vizier Ipy, one of the rock cut tombs along the cliff overlooking the temples at Deir el-Bahri. The documents - some still folded, tied and sealed, when found -  provide unique insights into the domestic and financial affairs of an average middle class family that lived almost four thousand years ago.This is the front side (recto) of letter I, written, probably by Heqanakht himself, in columns from right to left on a pristine sheet of papyrus in hieratic script with black ink. It is addressed to Heqanakht's family, specifically to a man called Merisu, who was a kind of steward responsible for the functioning of the household and its production. In the letter Heqanakht gives instructions to send two individuals (Nakht, possibly Merisu's deputy, and Sinebniut, a subordinate) to rent land in a place named Perhaa. He makes comments on the rental fee of land previously leased and gives directions about the rations to be provided for the man Nakht on his mission to Perhaa.img_url to a blog about scribes in Ancient EgyptShowing Signs: Hieroglyphs and Palettes in the Stela of Irtisen",

Under the disintegrating forces of the French Revolution (1789-1794), the 18th century confidence, some might say smugness, in its uniformity of aesthetic beliefs was to disappear.  The restless need for social and political reform, which began in the 1780s and was fostered through the works of the philosophes, resulted in new patterns of consumption and new forms of self-expression.  For a time, however, the ideas, values and aesthetics of the Ancien Régime competed and co-existed with those of the founding Republic.This jockeying for position between the old and new elites gave birth to a variety of hybrid or transitional styles of dress, this suit being an outstanding example.  Comprising a coat with narrow sleeves and a straight, cut-away skirt, a short vest or gilet and a pair of breeches that covered the legs below the knees, it recalls the cool Neoclassicism of the Enlightenment.  At the same time, its simple lines and complete absence of decoration reflects the Anglomania that had been a feature of male fashions in France since the 1740s, but which came to the fore in the 1780s.  The opulence and frenzied frivolity of Ancien Régime court dress or habits à la française, however, remain in its luxurious fabric and its lurid, effervescent color.  Its stand-up collar is also a vestige of the old order, but its exaggerated height anticipates the style of the Incroyables.  Like these giddy young men of the mid- to late 1790s, the wearer of this suit was almost certainly an élégant, an 'enlightened' aristocrat who hid his anti-Jacobin tendencies by adopting the puritanical design vocabulary of the republicans.",

The composition in the center is closest to the Virgin of the Rocks. These sketches, however, seem more closely related to an undocumented painting from around 1483–85 by Leonardo that must have been brought at least to the stage of a complete cartoon (full-scale drawing); several contemporary painted copies of this composition survive. Leonardo explored a number of solutions to the same theme on the sheet with dazzling fluency.

Elegant figures in contemporary or theatrical dress were not posed or placed to conform to explicit narratives, but rather were based on the individual studies made from life that filled his sketchbooks.Admired for their mise-en-page, Watteau's drawings often combine separate studies, as seen here, where a study of a woman’s hands is set below an oblique study of a her head, seen from above. In a painterly mix of red chalk and silvery-gray graphite, Watteau captures his sitter's natural comportment, drawing attention to elegant details, such as her cheekbone, her drop earring, and her delicate necklace. Although he parted with few in his lifetime, Watteau's chalk drawings became well-known after his death thanks to his friend Jean de Jullienne's project of publishing etchings after his drawings under the title, Figures de différents caractères (1726–28).",

Jade beads, in the form of round appliques that would once have been painted blue-green, decorate the ankles, biceps, nostrils, and shoulders of the figure. The main chamber of the censer below contains a stylized series of sculpted and painted bundle motifs, including crenulated jaguar pelts, a beaded medallion, a knot of rope, and what may be a shark tooth and canine fangs.The seated figure may be a depiction of an Early Classic (ca. A.D. 250–550) Maya ruler. At least four other incense burner lids of the same type exist, and one contains a hieroglyphic name in the medallion on the front of the headdress. If once present, such a painted name is missing from the circular medallion in the current example. The headdresses of the rulers in the set vary greatly, suggesting a group of different rulers, or perhaps a single ruler impersonating different deities. This ruler’s headdress contains wide spiraled eyes underlined by beaded motifs directly above the forehead of the individual. A wide strap that borders the face and attaches below the chin may be a representation of the jaws of the deity; the ruler’s face thus emerges from the maw of the supernatural. A beaded headband contains two splays of feathers to the left and to the right. The elaborate earflare assemblage, including round flares supported by a perpendicular cylindrical post through each, contains tri-lobed ornaments below and a spiraled element above. The large ear ornaments cross the plane between real and mythical; the viewers see them as simultaneously worn by both the ruler and the deity.Incense, in the form of tree resins such as copal (Protium copal), was a key component of ancient Maya rituals, as well as in contemporary rituals of Maya descendants. Ritual practitioners and royal families made offerings of burning incense to communicate with ancestors and deities in the supernatural realm. Maya artists depicted fragrant incense smoke in monumental sculpture and paintings; clouds of smoke were vehicles for ancestors to communicate with the living. This incense burner and others like it may depict ancestors of the rulers who burned incense in their chambers, or they may have been used to venerate a ruler after death, with the sacred smoke encouraging his apotheosis.Published ReferencesFields, Virginia, and Dorie Reents-Budet.

These two younger princesses appear in this facsimile beside Nefertiti's large figure with her heel drawn up against her buttocks. She is clad in white with a red pleated sash that flows down between her two daughters. The small children have many bead necklaces and bracelets, and large earrings with pendant bead strings. One draws the face of the second toward her. The painting is very fine: for example, a white underlayer is used to brighten specific tones, the rare pigment orpiment provides bright yellows, and shading intimates the roundness of figures.Scenes of the royal family as an intimate, affectionate circle reprsent the aura of blessedness bestowed on Akhenaten by the Aton. Such representations are iconic in the set of scenes central to the Aten religion, and, in fact, appear in temple relief.",

Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (MMA 64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings.",

    "contextual_sentences": "Even before the detailed processes of Talbot and Daguerre were revealed, a third inventor had successfully obtained photographic images using a process of his own creation. Hippolyte Bayard, experimenting in the hours left free from his civil service job, had brought his process from conception to fruition in the short space of a few months early in 1839. Like Daguerre's technique, Bayard's was a direct-positive process; like Talbot's, it produced photographs on paper. Each picture required some thirty minutes of exposure.This photograph, inscribed on the verso \"Essai de 1839 Avril Mai,\" is one of Bayard's earliest surviving prints and among the rarest of photographic incunabula. Its chemical stains and slight discoloration only heighten the modern viewer's sense of bearing witness to the magic that first enabled sensitized paper to retain an image thrown by the lens of a camera obscura.The picturesque windmills of Montmartre, the outlying suburb that was becoming the bohemian quarter of Paris, were a frequent subject of Bayard's earliest photographs, and likely figured in some of the thirty pictures shown by the artist in the first public exhibition of photographs, held in Paris in July 1839. Remembering that occasion a dozen years later, the critic Francis Wey wrote of the exhibited works, \"They resembled nothing I had ever seen. … One contemplates these direct positives as if through a fine curtain of mist. Very finished and accomplished, they unite the impression of reality with the fantasy of dreams: light grazes and shadow caresses them.\"",

They were commissioned for the queen’s Grand Cabinet Intérieur at Versailles, where she kept the collection of Japanese lacquer boxes she had inherited from her mother, Empress Maria Theresa (1717 – 1780) of Austria. So that their surface decoration would harmonize with that of the boxes, choice fragments of seventeenth-century Japanese lacquer were reused as veneer for these pieces of royal furniture. The shiny black and gold lacquer and lustrous ebony form a striking background for the exceptionally beautiful gilt-bronze mounts (see detail page 102). Consisting of swags and interlaced garlands of naturalistic flowers, these jewel-like mounts incorporate the queen’s initials in the frieze as well as handles shaped like rippling ribbons. Enclosed behind the fall front of the secretary, several secret drawers are hidden beneath the hinged floor of the central compartment. These small drawers, as well as a strongbox that could be locked separately, offered places to store valuables and protect personal correspondence from prying eyes. The queen undoubtedly used them, for she never believed any papers were safe at the court, according to the Austrian diplomat Florimond-Claude, comte de Mercy-Argenteau (1727 – 1794). He had reported to her mother many years earlier that the dauphine was fearful of duplicate keys and apprehensive that things would be taken from her pockets at night. [1]The history of these famous pieces of furniture is remarkably well documented. Marie-Antoinette frequently changed the decor of her private rooms, and in 1787 she had the commode and secretary sent from Versailles to her new summer palace at Saint-Cloud. Both pieces left the royal collections when they were given in lieu of payment for his services during the Revolution to Abraham Alcan, a contractor of supplies for the army of the Rhine and Moselle. During the nineteenth century, the queen's secretary and commode were part of several notable British collections. George Watson Taylor (1770 - 1841) kept them at his country house, Erlestoke Park, in Wiltshire, and later they belonged to the dukes of Hamilton. At the famous Hamilton Palace sale of 1882 the royal pieces were acquired for Mrs. William Kissam Vanderbilt (1853 - 1933 ), one of the reigning society hostesses of New York City, for her mansion on Fifth Avenue. Her daughter Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan (1877 - 1964) remembered Marie-Antoinette's lacquer secretaire and commode standing in the white drawing room, which was hung with a set of Boucher tapestries.

Parmigianino's involvement in printmaking went even further when, sometime in the mid-1520s, he took up the etching needle himself to experiment with this new technique. He was the first Italian to exploit the possibilities of etching, in which lines are freely scratched through a waxy ground, to directly translate the draftsman's manner. He produced no more than fifteen etchings, yet his example was to inspire the future development of a distinctly Italian printmaking tradition. This is one of Parmigianino's most beautiful prints, that demonstrates his sensitivity to landscape, as well as his characteristically graceful and elongated figure types.",

    "title": "Cuneiform tablet case impressed with four cylinder seals, for cuneiform tablet 66.245.15a: quittance",
    "contextual_sentences": "Kültepe, the ancient city of Kanesh, was a powerful and cosmopolitan city located in northern Cappadocia in central Anatolia.  During the early second millennium B.C., it became part of the network of trading settlements established across the region by merchants from Ashur (in Assyria in northern Mesopotamia). Travelling long distances by donkey caravan, and often living separately from their families, these merchants traded vast quantities of tin and textiles for gold and silver in addition to controlling the copper trade within Anatolia itself.  Although the merchants adopted many aspects of local Anatolian life, they brought with them Mesopotamian tools used to record transactions: cuneiform writing, clay tablets and envelopes, and cylinder seals. Using a simplified version of the elaborate cuneiform writing system, merchants tracked loans as well as business deals and disputes, and sent letters to families and business partners back in Ashur. These texts also provide information about the greater political history of Ashur and the Anatolian city-states as well as details about the daily life of Assyrians and Anatolians who not only worked side-by-side, but also married and had children together. At Kültepe, thousands of these texts stored in household archives were preserved when fire destroyed the city in ca. 1836 B.C. and provide a glimpse into the complex and sophisticated commercial and social interactions that took place in the Near East during the beginning of the second millennium B.C.This case once enclosed a cuneiform tablet (66.245.15a) which recorded the repayment of a loan from Karriya and Ashur-nada. The repayment of 9 ½ minas of silver was made in Kanesh, and because the tablet recording the original details of the loan was still in Ashur, this quittance was written to record completion of the transaction. The tablet is impressed with four cylinder seals belonging to the three witnesses to the loan repayment as well as Assur-tab, the son of Karriya who facilitated in the repayment. The variety of cylinder seals used on the envelope is typical of the artistic creativity and flexibility present at Kültepe. Two of the seals belong to the Old Assyrian stylistic tradition: the first depicts nude belted heroes bearing a flowing vase before a seated deity and the second depicts a procession of divine and human figures before a seated deity. The cuneiform inscription on this seal reads: “Puzur-Ishtar, son of Shu-Anum, the overseer”; a person not actually involved in the transaction. During the Old Assyrian period, seals inscribed with personal names were less common and when present, did not always correlate to the seal owner.The third impression is from an Anatolian style seal with imagery borrowed from the traditional Mesopotamian presentation scene: a seated figure in a conical cap is approached by a kneeling male holding a bird-headed standard, and a Mesopotamian bull man wrestles a lion by its tail. The scene also includes an Anatolian weather god holding a cup and the reins of the bull on which he stands. Furthermore, the field of the images is filled with numerous animals and animal parts floating at all angles and the figures are rendered in a less linear style than that of the Assyrian tradition.The fourth impression is from a cylinder seal belonging to a royal official of the Ur III   king Ibbi-Sin. The inscription, framed in two registers and written in Sumerian, identifies  the original owner of the seal: “Ibbi-Sin, the valiant king, the king of Ur, the king of the  four quarters (of the world), Ur-lugal-banda, the scribe, son of Ur-nigin-gar, is your  servant.” The image is a presentation scene in which the interceding goddess Lamma   leads a worshipper toward the deified king. Ur III-period seals were used by Old Assyrian merchants as heirloom items and in some cases the legend was erased and re-cut with that of the new owner.  In this example, the original inscription was left intact.",

    "contextual_sentences": "The eight-day, spring-wound movement of this timepiece, signed “J. Thuret,” was most likely the work of Isaac II Thuret, clockmaker to Louis XIV and a member of an important family of horologists. In May 1691 he organized a lottery with a repeater clock on a pedestal as first prize. This piece was fitted with a barometer and, in addition, was richly decorated with gilt bronze. It appears to have been very similar to the Museum’s clock and gives a good indication of its date. Just like the first prize in the lottery, the Museum’s clock was intended to hold a barometer in its pedestal (see detail far right). Five inscriptions near the top alluding to various weather conditions, ranging from tourment[e] (tempest) to tres sec (very dry), form the perimeter of the dial of a barometer, although the piece appears never to have been used as such.The case and pedestal of the clock, ornamented with marquetry of tortoiseshell, brass, and pewter, have been attributed to the royal ébéniste André-Charles Boulle, “who makes a sort of Mosaick works extremely neat, and which the Curious preserve very choicely,” according to Germain Brice’s popular guidebook of 1687, A New contextual_sentences of Paris.[1] Boulle is known to have made numerous clock cases in his workshop, which was housed in the Palais du Louvre, not far from the lodgings of the influential artist Jean Bérain. Some of Bérain’s engraved designs were used for the decoration of this clock. There is a striking harmony between the ornament of the case and of the dial. The timepiece is surmounted by royal symbols in gilt bronze: a sunburst with a mask of the sun god Apollo, a crown, and a pair of lyres, as well as a pair of cornucopias, the traditional symbol of abundance. Although all these emblems clearly refer to the Sun King and his reign, no royal provenance for this clock has been established.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:1. Germain Brice.

His nephew Gérardo added a magnificent staircase by the architect Andrea Tirali, the walls of which were decorated (1734) by Pietro Longhi.The bedroom here exhibited was the principal one of the palace.

    "title": "Architectural Model",
    "contextual_sentences": "Stone architectural models in the Mezcala style primarily come from the present-day state of Guerrero in southwest Mexico. A particularly long-lived tradition, these works may have been produced over some one thousand years, beginning as early as 500 BCE. Little is known about their archaeological contexts, and there are few points of reference with surviving architecture in the region. It is possible that models with pillars (see MMA 1979.206.431) reference buildings with stone columns, such as those from Cuetlajuchitlán.While Mezcala architectural models are generally referred to as temples, it has also been suggested that, when placed in graves, they were meant to serve as entrances into the spirit world or as dwelling places for the deceased (Gay, 1987). This model, with a single opening between thick walls set over a central staircase, places the focus on the entrance, which represents the building as a whole.Mezcala models may have served multiple functions over time, in keeping with the Mesoamerican custom of repurposing or re-carving stone objects. Oblong-shaped models, or ones with curved bases, for example, may have been re-carved from celts, ritual tools of great symbolic importance. Several have holes drilled into the base, which could have been used to fasten them with fiber to a larger item such as a ritual bundle, a practice widely known in archaeological and ethnographic contexts in Mesoamerica (see MMA 1994,35,700). Offerings of Mezcala stone objects in the Templo Mayor, the sacred center of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, built between 1325 and 1519, underscore the importance of these works as a continuation of tradition, as heirlooms, or as emulations of an ancient style.Further ReadingArqueología Mexicana, vol XIV, núm 82, El Estado de Guerrero. 2006.Gay, Carlo T.E.

The surface of the figure is decorated with the incised patterns and ridges of the coiffure, beard, eyebrows, and bracelets. In addition, a dense inscribed motif of bold concentric circles covers the chest and extends across the shoulders to the length of the back.Works such as this were once combined in ancestral ensembles comprising four to seven figures wrapped in textiles fastened around their shoulders and lower body. Individual sculptures were named after the particular ancestors they evoked. It seems that the largest and most impressive of the works in a particular group was invariably also the oldest, depicting a founding ancestor. That sculpture, it has been suggested, served as the model or prototype for the others, which represented successive generations of chiefs. The successive works added to the ensemble were sometimes by the same hand, but usually more than one sculptor was responsible for their execution. Stylistic features such as coiffure and posture further differentiated both sculptures and sculptors. Unlike portraiture, which seeks a certain specificity, this tradition of commemorative representation recasts contemporary leaders in the highly idealized, abstract idiom of their forebears. By preserving and perpetuating an artistic approach associated with the origins of the community, contemporary generations built a powerful bridge to the past.Boyo communities are a complex blend of regional peoples and cultural identities. The extensive cultural interaction that underlies their heritage has led to some dispute regarding the definition and place of Boyo sculptural traditions within the broader context of the region's art history. Because parallels can be drawn with artwork from the nearby Tumbwe, Tabwa, and Hemba peoples, some scholars theorize that Boyo sculptures served an important role as the basis for related sculptural traditions in the region.",

    "contextual_sentences": "A recent discovery, this sheet and seven others (acc. nos. 2008.105.1-8) comprised a manuscript draft for an Italian edition of the sole surviving architectural treatise of Roman antiquity, Ten Books on Architecture by Marcus Pollius Vitruvius (late first century B.C.). Had the project been completed, it would have ranked among the brilliantly imaginative works of Renaissance interpretive architectural theory. The drawings also exhibit a beautifully expressive handling of the pen. Comparisons of style as well as of the shorthand notation in the sketching of human figures suggest a close kinship with drawings by Bastiano \"Aristotile\" da Sangallo (Florence, 1481 – Florence 1551) and the collaborators that helped him draw and write the motifs of marginalia in a printed 1486 edition of Vitruvius (Biblioteca Corsiniana, Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Rome) that was reworked in the 1530s. By all accounts a virtuoso stage set designer, Bastiano da Sangallo-the cousin and closest collaborator of Antonio da Sangallo \"The Younger\" and Giovanni Battista da Sangallo \"Il Gobbo\"-was Michelangelo's assistant in the Sistine Chapel and took the surname of \"Aristotile\" for his love of antiquity. Members of the Sangallo family had been deeply interested in Vitruvius for at least two generations.Vitruvius sought to classify temples according to type, and the Florentine artist here has translated his text quite closely. The words at the top of the text may be rendered into English more or less as follows: \"It will be a temple in antis when it has the antae projecting in front of the walls that enclose the cella, and in the center between the antae, two columns, and over them the pediment, which is built with the kind of symmetrical proportions described later in this work. An example will be found at the Three Fortunes in one of the three that is nearest the Colline Gate.\" The bottom paragraph describes the prostyle temple as being similar to the temple in antis, but having two columns at its corners. Here, Vitruvius cited the example of the Temple of Jove and Faunus on the Isola Tiberina in Rome.",

Built by hand, the chamber of the vessel includes a cylindrical base, perhaps symbolizing a nest, which is indicated by gouged and incised designs of linear fields and cross-hatched areas. The round nest is surmounted by a bird, seated with its claws spread to the sides rather than perched, with its wings splayed to either side. The long tail feathers of the bird spill over the side of the nest. The bird opens its hooked, narrow beak, exposing its tongue as if beseeching the viewer for food. The opening of the vessel is a circular hole in the top of the bird’s head.Incised designs indicate the lines of the feathers on the wings and tail, the borders of the beak, and the circular eyes. This young raptor appears completely birdlike but has human ears extending from either side of the rounded head. The ears have contours and stretched lobes with depressions that indicate ear ornaments. Eagles and other birds of prey were powerful symbols in Olmec art, where they marked the realm of the sky and the precision of a hunter. The inclusion of humanlike ears here may indicate the intent of the artist to convey a moment of co-habitation or transformation from human to animal.Further readingBenson, Elizabeth P., and Beatriz de la Fuente, eds.Olmec Art of Ancient Mexico.

The man's upper body leans slightly forward, and the knees are held close against the chest. His left hand, carved in relief, rests on the left knee, while the right, now damaged, is a hollow fist supported by his right knee.

In origin he was an agricultural deity, but for the Assyrian kings it was his association with war and victory that gave him particular significance. One relief from the Ninurta Temple depicts the god’s most famous mythological exploit—recovering the \"Tablet of Destinies,\" on which was written the future of humanity, from the Anzu bird, a demon who often appears in art as a lion-headed eagle.The figure depicted here is winged and human-headed, and holds in his left hand part of a plant whose three branches end in rosettes.

Dürer's fascination with ideal form is manifest in Adam and Eve. The first man and woman are shown in nearly symmetrical idealized poses: each with the weight on one leg, the other leg bent, and each with one arm angled slightly upward from the elbow and somewhat away from the body. The figure of Adam is reminiscent of the Hellenistic Apollo Belvedere, excavated in Italy late in the fifteenth century. The first engravings of the sculpture were not made until well after 1504, but Dürer must have seen a drawing of it. Dürer was a complete master of engraving by 1504: human and snake skin, animal fur, and tree bark and leaves are rendered distinctively. The branch Adam holds is of the mountain ash, the Tree of Life, while the fig, of which Eve has broken off a branch, is from the forbidden Tree of Knowledge.

It is a reminder that many of the disembodied portrait heads displayed in these galleries were once attached to freestanding sculptures, whose original appearances were undoubtedly quite different. Portraits of the emperor served the highly important function in imperial propaganda of presenting the ruler to the public and of projecting the personality with which he wished to be perceived. Leadership and military strength are evoked in the heroic nudity of the figure and in the pose, which recalls the famous statue of Alexander the Great with the Lance by Lysippos. In contrast to the idealized body, the portrait head represents the emperor with brutish realism. Trebonianus likely would have cradled a parazonium, or short sword, in his left arm, and held a spear in his upraised right hand.The statue has undergone several campaigns of restoration since its discovery in the early nineteenth century and was examined in great detail as part of the conservation treatment in preparation for its display here. Visual examination inside and out, combined with x-radiography, made possible the clear identification of ancient and restored areas, which are indicated in the accompanying illustration. At least three-quarters of the statue is ancient. Despite the discrepancy in scale, the head belongs to the body. Although the mantle draped over his left shoulder is a modern restoration, cast edges beneath it confirm that the statue had a similar embellishment in antiquity.

These four tiles (MMA 32.150.5, 32.150.6, 32.150.7, 32.150.8), found in the remains of a vaulted reception room, or iwan, formed part of a larger wall covering. Because only one mold was needed to create the tiles, the intricate vine motif could be repeated endlessly and still be quite complex. The reconstruction suggests the effect of such panels in their original setting.The city of Ctesiphon was located on the east bank of the Tigris River, 20 miles (32 km) south of modern Baghdad in Iraq. It flourished for more than 800 years as the capital of the Parthians and the Sasanians, the last two dynasties to rule the ancient Near East before the Islamic conquest in the seventh century. Systematic excavations in the Ctesiphon area were undertaken by an expedition in 1928–29 sponsored by the German Oriental Society (Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft). The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Staatliche Museen, Berlin, undertook a joint expedition for one season in 1931–32. Several excavations were conducted, including at the main palace (Taq-i Kisra), in a small fortified area south of the palace at Tell Dheheb, at multiple houses at the mounds of Ma’aridh, and at additional houses at a small mound called Umm ez-Za’tir.Over the course of the excavations in the Ctesiphon area, six houses from a series of small mounds called el Ma’aridh were excavated. The house at Ma’aridh VI was only partially excavated and a plan of the building was not made. The stucco fragments from the house, however, suggest that the cruciform niches in the reception area were richly decorated.",

Here, he invented elegant \"s\" shaped rhythms for the figural pose.  The woman is seen in bust-length from the back, her head turned in profile, slightly lowered, to gaze directly at the viewer, while the exquisite complexity of details of her fashionable dress soften her pose with airy curves and twists.  Her fantastic coiffure is laden with braids curled around a pair of ram's horns, while her artfully puffed-up dress, with layers of agitated drapery, is fastened on the back with a mask-like brooch.  Although minor passages were touched up with ink and the figure was silhouetted with wash at a later time, the characteristic clarity and precision of Rosso's original drawing in chalk are plainly evident.  The delicately ornate mount and the pen inscription below, telling the colorful, apocryphal story about the presumed subject of the drawing, are both due to the British collector John Talmann, who incorrectly thought this to be a portrait of Giulia Gonzaga (1513-1566), Contess of Fondi, a famous beauty in her day.(Carmen C.

    "title": "Bannerstone, Double-Notched Butterfly",
    "contextual_sentences": "Made between 6000 and 1000 BCE, bannerstones are amongst the oldest finely carved lithics in the Americas. Indigenous Archaic North Americans created them from Michigan to the tip of Florida and from the Mississippi Valley over to the Atlantic coast. They carved and polished them with a peck and grind technology using a vast range of materials from soft sedimentary shale, to metamorphic slate or harder rock such as granite or quartz. Though bannerstones have been found in twenty-four different shapes, each one is a unique composition where sculptors appear to delight in the interplay of geologic characteristics in relation to the forms they sculpt. Using a hollow river reed, twisting it back and forth between their hands, adding water and sand to bite into the stone, they would drill a 1 to 2 centimeter hole down the center of the bannerstones for them to be hafted onto a shaft and hoisted to be seen. In some Archaic burials, bannerstones were found intentionally broken at the perforation where they are most fragile and carefully placed next to or on the body of the dead. This mortuary ritual use of bannerstones placed with and beside men, women, and children, attest to their importance in life and to their role in the act of mourning and remembrance. Some bannerstones were found in other burials aligned with atlatls, throwing sticks that extend the flight of a spear, leading scholars to hypothesize that they may have been hafted to atlatls as accessories or weights. Many bannerstones are far too large or small to be used in this manner leaving open the question of why they were only made in the Archaic period in Eastern North America and ceased to be made after 1000 BCE when atlatl use would continue for several centuries before the advent of the bow and arrow. Many bannerstones were found in areas at great distances from the geologic origin of the stone, revealing deep interest in stone texture and color and long distance travel and trade amongst Archaic sculptors. Whatever their purpose, the thousands of bannerstones in private and public collections are testament to the importance of stone for individual aesthetic expression during the Archaic Period in North America.An Archaic sculptor created this Double-Notched Butterfly bannerstone carefully aligning the natural banding of the slate with the central raised ridge of the stone. The thinning of the flanges out from the thicker central ridge creates the appearance of undulating concentric waves of the dark bands of the slate. The sculptor may have chosen this particular stone because of the large off-white serpentine inclusion on one side that runs across and through the slate banding, adding an additional visual element to the composition. Sculptors often chose banded slate to carve these winged shapes categorized in the literature as \"Butterflies.\" There are scratches over the surface of the stone, evidence of the peck and grind technology used to shape and smooth the surface. There are multiple chips along the edges and at the perforation, signs of extensive use of this bannerstone in the Archaic period when it was placed on an atlatl (throwing stick) or staff. Along the narrow edge of one of the flanges the Museum’s accession number, 1979.206.403, is written in red.Anna Blume, Professor of the History of Art, Fashion Institute of Technology, State University of New York 2023References and Further ReadingKnoblock, Byron.Bannerstones of the North American Indian.

The subject wears a type of wig popular among royal women, but not exclusively so - it is also found on officials. The red skin color would point to a male, but skin color may not be a reliable indicator of sex in the Amarna Period. If a female were represented, it should be a princess forming part of a group and would be be placed in a shrine to the royal family at some home.

Evidence had increasingly indicated that trade between the Argolid and Cyprus was active and that the pictorial vases were a major commodity made on the mainland and traded eastward, probably for their contents as well as the ware itself. Scientific tests have corroborated these findings. Recent analyses have shown that this chariot krater came from a well-attested workshop in the vicinity of Mycenae and Berbati.The chariot was an important motif in art from the Greek mainland; its frequency on Mycenaean pictorial vases has characterized an entire subgroup. These vases were probably connected with funerary practices, and, in some regions, they may have served as sarcophagi.

Although many designs and wares made in Kyūshū were intended for export, works of Hizen ware known as the Nabeshima type were commissioned by the Nabeshima clan and produced at an exclusive kiln. A dish like this example would have been part of a dining service. These sets were frequently sent to the shogun in Edo (Tokyo) as an annual tribute. The cheerful design of jars on this dish features the bold, luminous colors and exacting standards characteristic of the high-quality porcelains produced at the Nabeshima kiln.",

    "title": "Saint Anthony the Abbot in the Wilderness",
    "contextual_sentences": "This panel is part of a cycle of scenes depicting the life of the hermit Saint Anthony Abbot. The painter's penchant for original and descriptive narrative detail appears in the treatment of the desert landscape and its fauna (symbols of the saint's temptations) beneath the luminous sky at dusk. A pot of gold in the lower left corner (which has been scraped away) symbolized the seductive worldly goods that the stalwart saint resists. The series of eight panels were likely arranged vertically, surrounding a central painted or sculpted image of Saint Anthony. The complex was probably commissioned for a member of the Sienese Martinozzi family (whose arms appear on one of the panels) for an Augustinian foundation, either in Siena or perhaps in the Marches region, where several branches of this family were located.This panel is the sixth in a series of eight that includes Saint Anthony at Mass (Gemäldegalerie, SMPK, Berlin); Saint Anthony Distributing His Wealth and Saint Anthony Blessed by an Old Hermit (both National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.); Saint Anthony Tempted by the Devil in the Guise of a Woman and Saint Anthony Beaten by Devils (both Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven); and Journey and Meeting of Saint Anthony with Saint Paul the Hermit and Funeral of Saint Anthony (both National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.).The enigmatic Osservanza Master has variously been identified as Sassetta and also as the young Sano di Pietro, based on close stylistic affinities with these other Sienese artists. It is also possible that the paintings attributed to the Osservanza Master, including the altarpiece from which this panel originated, are the product of a collaborative workshop to which these artists belonged.",

Inscribed \"Hieronymus in Deserto\" (Saint Jerome in the Wilderness), the image was printed after a design by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. It is one of a series of twelve prints known as the Large Landscapes, all of which reflect the deep impression the dramatic mountain vistas made on Bruegel as he traveled through the Alps on his return from Italy around 1554. Carried out primarily in etched lines that have the appearance of engraved ones the unsigned Large Landscapes were executed by the brothers Joannes and Lucas van Doetecum and published by Hieronymus Cock through his Antwerp shop, At the Four Winds. The prints, which were among the most widely circulated and celebrated of Bruegel's images, allowed a large audience to become acquainted with his strikingly naturalistic and broad-eyed conception of landscape.

Disobeying him, Psyche holds a light over his sleeping body, for which she is punished by Aphrodite. The scene conveyed by this modello is of Psyche being rescued in Cupid's embrace.Canova made two slightly different versions of this composition. The original Cupid and Psyche, commissioned in 1787 by Scottish patron John Campbell while on his Grand Tour, was completed in 1793. It was later acquired by Napoleon's brother-in-law and is now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. This full-scale model was prepared for Canova's slightly different second version (showing Psyche with butterfly wings) made for Prince Nicolas Youssoupov and now in the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg. It was inherited by Canova's assistant, Adamo Tadolini (1788–1868), who used it to replicate additional versions. The metal pins distributed over the surface were inserted to assist the sculptor in transferring the complex group's precise form from plaster to the marble block out of which the final sculpture would be carved, by means of the pointing system.",

The luxurious mina˒i ceramic technique of these tiles is reminiscent of that associated with the luxury vessels made in Kashan, Iran. The stucco reliefs also recall the artistic language developing both in the eastern and western parts of the Seljuq realm, which eventually extended into Christian lands, as seen in comparable stucco reliefs found at the Armenian capital at Ani. The imagery of real and fantastic animals, such as this sphinx (1976.245), and scenes of equestrian combat or royal hunt – illustrated for example through the motif of chasing animals seen in stucco fragments (1984.505a-d) – aimed to re-create an earthly paradise or the ideal life and just dominion of the sovereign presiding over this cosmos. It also offered supernatural and magical protection to the ruler, his entourage, and the sultanate. The Konya Köşk, although situated in an urban environment, evoked the ideal natural setting awaiting the sultan at his country pavilions as well as the paradisiacal ideal awaiting him in heaven.",

Seldom did they self-consciously strive for art. This full-plate daguerreotype, the first important French photograph of the 1840s to enter the Museum's collection, is one such rarity.Made during an excursion through eastern France just five years after the daguerreotype's invention, this remarkable picture demonstrates how the camera prompted artists to see and represent the world in new ways. Rather than employing pictorial devices or perspectival and atmospheric effects rooted in the traditions of landscape painting, Choiselat and Ratel emphasized the two-dimensional organization of the picture's surface. The poplars, reflected in the water, seem to stretch across the plate from top to bottom instead of sitting on the far side of the pond; the cottage (perhaps a rustic pleasure house for the château beyond) forms, with its reflection, a single geometric solid floating in space.",

    "title": "Pair of five-light candelabra",
    "contextual_sentences": "After the death of his father in 1763, Prince Marcantonio Borghese (1730–1800) inherited a great fortune that included the finest private art collection in the Eternal City.[1] His subsequent role as one of the most important collector-patrons of the Neoclassical period –rivaling, in his own family, Cardinal Scipione Borghese (1576–1633) in the Early Baroque era – has not received the attention that it deserves.[2] The creator of this pair of candelabra, Luigi Valadier (1726–1785), became the principal goldsmith for Prince Marcantonio, who was close to him in age, thus extending the ties that the artisan's father, the goldsmith Andrea Valadier (d. 1757), had established to the Borghese court decades earlier.[3]The superior design and precise, finely detailed craftsmanship of the present five-light candelabra place them among the most distinguished art objects created in the second half of the eighteenth century, an exciting period of Roman creativity influenced by the theories of Johann Joachim Winckelmann and the progressive inventions of Giovanni Battista Piranesi.[4] Thanks to the archival research of Alvar González-Palacios, we know a great deal about the circumstances of their manufacture. They were made for the suite of public rooms in the Palazzo Borghese in Rome that the architect Antonio Asprucci was redecorating for Prince Marcantonio.[5] They were to be displayed on two small tables – also executed in the color scheme of deep red porphyry and gilded bronze – in the Galleriola dei Cesari (so called because sixteen ancient porphyry busts of Roman emperors were on view there in niches).[6] Porphyry has been associated since Roman times with personages \"born in the purple\"; it is also a difficult stone to work. González-Palacios suggests that Lorenzo Cardelli, a stone carver who collaborated with Valadier on several mantelpieces of porphyry and marble the following year, made the porphyry elements for these candelabra.[7]Rising from each candelabrum's porphyry drum decorated with gilded bronze bucrania and swags in the classical style, the porphyry shaft curves up in the form of a baluster to become a small bowl at the top, decorated with gilded lions' heads and three whimsical Roman theatrical masks, from which sprout clusters of gilded bronze leaves and long branches that terminate in sockets for candles. Standing on the drum and encircling the baluster are three bronze female figures that appear to support the basin but in fact are purely decorative. Valadier's invoice for works he executed for the palazzo Borghese (dated September 6, 1774) identifies the figures as a Venus, an Amazon, and a Muse and says they were based on clsasical Roman statues.[8] The Venus, shown turned toward the shaft – the better to display her beautiful posterior – was based on an ancient marble then at the Villa Farnesina in Rome and now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples. Often reproduced, in various media, it was a popular souvenir with foreign visitors on the grand tour. The figure Valadier describes as a Muse recalls the huntress Diana in the collection of the Palazzo Verospi in Rome. The prototype of the Amazon is a marble sculpture today in the Musei Vaticani. Valadier reproduced it in 1780 as a large bronze statue (now at the Château de Malmaison, outside Paris).[9]Valadier's idea of grouping three caryatid figures around the shaft of his candelabra may have originated with Piranesi, who engraved a celebrated ancient statue of the three Graces that was at the time on display in the Villa Borghese.[10] Nevertheless, both the forward-looking design and the daring combination of decorative elements with such divergent roots show that Valadier was well ahead of most contemporary makers of decorative objects. He had an important influence on English artists and metalwork, as a comparison of the upper part of his candelabra with English goldsmiths' work of the 1810s to the 1840s shows. Future research may reveal whether a similar pair of candelabra entered an influential English collection during the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century, or whether an English artisan in Italy bought drawings of the candelabra home to the British Isles during those years.[11] Parallels with the oeuvre of Benjamin Lewis Vulliamy (1780–1854) are especially striking. In 1811 his British firm made for the Prince Regent a pair of candelabra with simpler ornaments and with sculptural details after English plasters that nevertheless reflect the design of the Metropolitan's candelabra.[12][Wolfram Koeppe 2008]Footnotes1.

    "title": "Great Indian Fruit Bat",
    "contextual_sentences": "This dramatic image is of the great Indian fruit bat (Pteropus giganteus) frontally displayed with one wing out-stretched. The body is shown in considerable detail, with the bat’s fur, eyes, curling claws, and wing veins naturalistically articulated. This work is closely related to another image of a bat painted by the well-known artist Bhawani Das, who was trained in Mughal miniature painting and commissioned by Sir Elijah Impey, Chief Justice of Bengal (1774–1782), and his wife, Lady Mary, to make extensive natural history studies at their estate in Calcutta. It was perhaps made by a follower of Bhawani Das who worked in a slightly more naturalistic mode.",
